# Getting Started

Welcome! Setting up or joining a Chamber is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through your first steps as a member or a founder.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Users

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
To interact with a Chamber, you’ll need a digital wallet (like MetaMask or Rainbow). Click the **Connect Wallet** button at the top of the app to get started.

### 2. Find Your Community
Browse the **Dashboard** to see active Chambers. Each Chamber represents a different community or organization. You can see what assets they manage and who is currently on their Board.

### 3. Join a Chamber
To become a member, you typically need to:
- **Deposit Assets**: Contribute to the Chamber's vault to receive shares. These shares represent your "weight" in the community.
- **Hold an NFT**: Some Chambers require you to own a specific NFT to sit on the Board or participate in governance.

## 🏗️ Founding a New Chamber

If you want to start your own organization, click **Deploy Chamber** on the dashboard. You will need to decide a few things:

- **Treasury Asset**: What token will your community use? (e.g., USDC, LOREUM).
- **Membership NFT**: Which NFT collection represents your members or potential leaders?
- **Board Size**: How many Directors should your organization have? (Usually an odd number like 3, 5, or 7).
- **Name & Symbol**: Give your community a name and a token symbol for its shares.

## 🛠️ The Daily Workflow

Once you are part of a Chamber, here is how you participate:

### Support Your Leaders
Go to the **Delegation** tab. Here, you can see all the NFT holders who want to lead. Use your shares to "Delegate" to the people you trust. Your support helps them stay on or join the Board.

### Propose and Vote (For Directors)
If you are one of the top supported members, you are a **Director**:
1. **Submit**: Create a new transaction in the **Transactions** tab.
2. **Review**: Look at transactions submitted by other Directors.
3. **Confirm**: Click confirm on transactions you agree with.
4. **Execute**: Once a transaction has enough confirmations, any Director can click "Execute" to finalize it.
