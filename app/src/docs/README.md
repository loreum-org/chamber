# Chamber Protocol

Welcome to the official documentation for the Chamber Protocol. 

Chamber is a decentralized governance platform that allows communities to manage their assets through a dynamic, community-elected Board of Directors.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Community-Led Governance**: Use your tokens to delegate support to leaders you trust.
- **Dynamic Boards**: The Board of Directors automatically updates as community sentiment shifts.
- **Secure Treasury**: Quorum-based transaction management ensures that no single member has control over community funds.
- **Transparant Operations**: Every governance action and financial move is visible on the blockchain.
