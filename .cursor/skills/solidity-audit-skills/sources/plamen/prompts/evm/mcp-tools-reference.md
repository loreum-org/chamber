# MCP Tools Reference

> **MCP tools (`mcp__slither-analyzer__*`, `mcp__unified-vuln-db__*`) are available directly.** The servers are configured globally in `~/.claude.json` and load automatically at session start. Call them directly - no ToolSearch or loading step needed.
>
> **If a tool call fails with "No such tool available"**, it means the MCP server failed to start. Check with `claude mcp list` and restart the session.

> **MCP tools are your PRIMARY interface to Slither and the vulnerability database.** Call `mcp__slither-analyzer__*` and `mcp__unified-vuln-db__*` tools DIRECTLY - never route through Bash or CLI unless the MCP call itself has failed. This is not a preference; it is a hard requirement. CLI is the fallback, not the default.
>
> **PROHIBITED SUBSTITUTIONS**: NEVER use `mcp__farofino__slither_audit` or any `mcp__farofino__*` tool for Slither operations. `farofino` is a separate MCP server - it is NOT a substitute for `mcp__slither-analyzer__*`. The ONLY approved namespaces are `mcp__slither-analyzer__*` (for Slither) and `mcp__unified-vuln-db__*` (for vulnerability DB). Calling `farofino` instead of `slither-analyzer` is a workflow violation identical to skipping MCP entirely.

> **Mental model**: You are good at understanding INTENT and tracing LOGIC. Tools are good at EXHAUSTIVE ENUMERATION. You miss things when scanning large files manually. Tools never skip anything but can't understand intent. **Use both.**

> **MCP TIMEOUT POLICY (MANDATORY)**: When an MCP tool call returns a timeout error or fails, do NOT retry the same call. Record `[MCP: TIMEOUT]` and skip ALL remaining calls to that provider - switch immediately to fallback (code analysis, grep, WebSearch). Claude Code's default tool timeout is 60s (configurable via `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` env var). You cannot cancel a pending call, but you control what happens after the error returns.

### Slither Failure Policy (GLOBAL)

> Slither can permanently fail on certain projects (namespace imports like `import X as Y`, mixed compiler versions, unusual AST). When it fails, it will **never** succeed on that project - retrying wastes time.

**Recon (Phase 1)**: The recon agent probes Slither with ONE `list_contracts` call. If it fails → `SLITHER_AVAILABLE = false` for the entire audit. All Slither tasks switch to grep fallback. See `phase1-recon-prompt.md` TASK 2 for details.

**Depth agents (Phase 4b)**: If recon set `SLITHER_AVAILABLE = false` (documented in `build_status.md`), depth agents MUST NOT call any `mcp__slither-analyzer__*` tools. Use `Read` tool to read source files directly instead of `get_function_source`. Use grep for caller/callee tracing instead of `get_function_callees/callers`.

**Verification (Phase 5)**: Verifiers check `build_status.md` for Slither status. If unavailable, use `Read` tool for all source extraction.

| Tool | What It Gives You | When to Use | What You'd Miss Without It |

|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `get_root_cause_analysis(bug_class)` | Why specific bug classes occur | Step 1c - prime your analysis |
| `get_attack_vectors(bug_class)` | How exploits work mechanically | Depth agents - understand exploit mechanics |

### Live Solodit API (50k+ findings - MANDATORY for comprehensive analysis)

| Tool | What It Gives You | When to Use |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `search_solodit_live(...)` | Full Solodit database search | **MANDATORY** during hypothesis validation and deep dives |

**MANDATORY Usage - Call `search_solodit_live` when:**
1. Local search returns < 5 results → Expand search
2. Validating HIGH/CRITICAL hypothesis → Cross-reference comprehensively
3. Protocol-specific deep dive → Search by protocol name
4. Understanding attack patterns → Search by vulnerability tags

**Parameters:**
```
search_solodit_live(
  keywords="first depositor inflation",     # Free-text search
  impact=["HIGH", "MEDIUM"],                # Severity filter
  tags=["First Depositor", "ERC4626"],      # Solodit vulnerability tags
  protocol="{PROTOCOL_NAME}",                # Protocol name (partial match)
  protocol_category=["DeFi"],               # Category filter (array)
  firms=["{RELEVANT_FIRM}"],                # Audit firm filter
  language="Solidity",                      # Language: Solidity/Rust/Cairo/Move
  quality_score=3,                          # Min quality (0-5), use >=3 for good findings
  rarity_score=3,                           # Min rarity (0-5), unique patterns
  min_finders=1, max_finders=1,            # Solo finds only (hardest bugs)
  reported="90",                            # Time: 30/60/90/alltime
  sort_by="Quality",                        # Quality/Recency/Rarity
  sort_direction="Desc",                    # Desc/Asc
  max_results=20                            # Up to 50
)
```

**Pro tips for better recall:**
- Use `quality_score=3` to filter noisy/low-quality findings
- Use `language="Solidity"` to avoid cross-language noise (important for non-EVM searches)
- Use `max_finders=1` to find solo discoveries (often the hardest, most unique bugs)
- Combine `protocol_category` + `tags` for targeted domain searches

**Common Solodit Tags**: Reentrancy, Oracle, Access Control, Flash Loan, Front-running,
Price Manipulation, Logic Error, DOS, Griefing, Signature, Upgrade, Initialization,
Precision Loss, Rounding, First Depositor, Share Inflation, ERC4626, Liquidation,
Governance, Cross-chain, Bridge, Slippage, Timestamp, Randomness, Delegatecall

## Static Analysis Escalation Ladder

When Slither MCP fails, use this fallback chain:

| Priority | Tool | What It Provides | When to Use |
|----------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 (Primary) | `mcp__slither-analyzer__*` | Full AST analysis, call graphs, detectors | Always attempt first via probe call |
| 2 (Fallback A) | `mcp__farofino__aderyn_audit` | Rust-based static analysis, common vulns | When Slither probe fails |
| 3 (Fallback B) | `mcp__farofino__pattern_analysis` | Pattern-based detection (reentrancy, tx.origin, etc.) | Alongside Aderyn when Slither fails |
| 4 (Fallback C) | `mcp__farofino__read_contract` | Contract source reading | When Slither `get_function_source` unavailable |
| 5 (Manual) | Grep + Read tools | Manual pattern search | When all MCP tools fail |

> **Note**: `mcp__farofino__slither_audit` is NOT a substitute for `mcp__slither-analyzer__*`. The farofino Slither wrapper uses a different configuration. Only use `mcp__farofino__aderyn_audit` and `mcp__farofino__pattern_analysis` as complements.

**Recon policy**: If Slither probe fails → immediately run Aderyn + Pattern Analysis. Do not wait. Document all tool availability in `build_status.md`.

**Depth agent policy**: If `build_status.md` shows SLITHER_AVAILABLE = false, use Read tool for source extraction and Grep for caller/callee tracing. Do NOT attempt Slither MCP calls.

## tavily-search - Web Research

| Tool | What It Gives You | When to Use |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `mcp__tavily-search__tavily_search` | Web search results | During recon for protocol documentation, known issues |
| `mcp__tavily-search__tavily_extract` | Extract content from URLs | When documentation URL is provided by user |
| `mcp__tavily-search__tavily_research` | Deep research on topic | Understanding protocol architecture from public sources |
| `mcp__tavily-search__tavily_crawl` | Crawl site for content | Gathering comprehensive documentation from protocol site |

**Fork Ancestry usage**: Use `tavily_search` during TASK 0 to research known vulnerabilities of detected parent codebases: `tavily_search(query="{parent_name} smart contract vulnerability exploit")`. See FORK_ANCESTRY skill for methodology.
