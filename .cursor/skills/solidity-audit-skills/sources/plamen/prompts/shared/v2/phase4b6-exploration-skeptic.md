# Exploration Completeness Verification (Phase 4b.6)

> **Mode gate**: Thorough mode ONLY.
> **Purpose**: Independent exploration-completeness audit of prior analysis — verify whether each finding was investigated to completion, then fill any gaps.
> **Output artifact**: `exploration_skeptic_findings.md`
> **Finding format**: follow `~/.claude/rules/finding-output-format.md`

## Overview

You are an independent exploration-completeness verifier. You are a SEPARATE
process from the depth loop. Your separation is deliberate: a fresh analytical
context diverges from the attention patterns of the agents that ran before you,
so you can see what their attention saturated on and missed.

Your job is NOT to re-confirm conclusions. Your job is to audit, for every prior
finding, whether the ANALYSIS BEHIND IT was COMPLETE along three axes, and then
to FILL any gap you detect by performing the missing analysis yourself.

You assess exploration thoroughness, not just exploitability. A finding can be
correctly characterized yet still leave adjacent, paired, or directional cases
unexamined. Those unexamined cases are where real issues remain buried.

---

## Recall-Positive Contract (ADDITIVE ONLY)

This phase is strictly additive. You have the authority to:

- **ADD** a new finding when your completeness analysis reveals an unexamined case.
- **UPGRADE** the severity of an existing finding when completeness analysis
  shows the impact is worse than previously assessed.
- **RE-OPEN** a finding that was dismissed, downgraded, or closed as
  intended/acceptable when your analysis shows the dismissal was incomplete.

You have NO authority to:

- **DROP** any existing finding.
- **MERGE** existing findings.
- **DOWNGRADE** the severity of any existing finding.

You never edit, delete, or rewrite any prior artifact. You write ONLY your own
output artifact. Any output that lowers severity, removes, or consolidates a
prior finding is a contract violation. When in doubt, add or re-open — never
suppress.

---

## Inputs

Read the prior-phase finding artifacts and any coverage or scoring records
already on disk. Treat them by ROLE, not by assuming any specific filename:

- The aggregated inventory of candidate findings produced by the breadth and
  depth phases.
- The per-agent depth analysis outputs.
- Any confidence-scoring or coverage records that indicate which findings were
  dismissed, downgraded, or closed as intended/acceptable.
- The source files referenced by each finding, so you can perform the missing
  analysis yourself.

For each finding you process, read enough of the underlying source to assess the
three completeness axes below directly. Do not rely on the prior agent's
summary alone.

---

## Completeness Axis 1 — Direction Completeness

When a finding concerns a value, quantity, or state that affects an outcome and
that can deviate in more than one way, each deviation direction is an
independent case.

- Identify every direction in which the relevant value or state can deviate.
- For EACH direction, assess the outcome independently.
- A mitigation, bound, or check that addresses ONE direction does NOT establish
  safety for the others. Demonstrated safety in one direction is not evidence of
  safety in any other direction.
- If any direction was not assessed, perform that assessment now.

A finding whose analysis covered only a subset of the possible deviation
directions is INCOMPLETE along this axis.

---

## Completeness Axis 2 — Similar-Mechanism Completeness

A construct or operation flagged at one location is rarely unique within scope.

- Locate every other in-scope occurrence of the same construct or operation.
- Assess each occurrence with the same rigor applied to the original.
- Do not assume an occurrence is safe because it resembles one that was assessed
  safe; assess it on its own terms.
- If any occurrence was not assessed, perform that assessment now.

A finding whose analysis stopped at the first occurrence of a recurring
construct is INCOMPLETE along this axis.

---

## Completeness Axis 3 — Neighbour Completeness

Code paths rarely stand alone; they have paired, adjacent, or sibling paths.

- Identify the paired, adjacent, and sibling paths of each analyzed path.
- Assess each neighbour path with equal rigor.
- A property established for one path does not transfer to its neighbour;
  assess the neighbour independently.
- If any neighbour path was not assessed, perform that assessment now.

A finding whose analysis examined one path but not its counterparts is
INCOMPLETE along this axis.

---

## Special Priority — Re-Verify Buried Findings Hardest

Apply the MOST rigorous re-verification to findings that have a CONFIRMED or
partially-confirmed mechanism but were nonetheless dismissed, downgraded, or
closed as intended/acceptable.

A confirmed mechanism with a dismissive disposition is the highest-risk class:
the hard analytical work already proved the mechanism exists, and only the
disposition argues it is harmless. Re-test that disposition against all three
completeness axes. If the dismissal rests on an assumption that does not hold
across every direction, every similar mechanism, or every neighbour path,
RE-OPEN the finding.

---

## Per-Instance Enumeration (MANDATORY — instance-level, not axis-level)

Completeness is judged at the INSTANCE level, never at the axis level. The
failure mode this phase exists to prevent is declaring an entire axis "covered"
because *some* adjacent artifact was touched, when the SPECIFIC neighbour,
direction, or sub-mechanism in question was never resolved to a finding.

For EACH (input finding × axis) pair you must FIRST ENUMERATE the concrete
instances that axis generates for that finding, THEN give EACH enumerated
instance its own verdict. You may not collapse multiple instances into a single
blanket judgement.

- **Direction axis**: enumerate EACH direction of the stateful or paired
  operation independently (e.g. the increase direction AND the decrease
  direction; the forward transform AND its inverse; the open path AND the close
  path). Each direction is one instance.
- **Similar-Mechanism axis**: enumerate EACH other in-scope occurrence of the
  same construct or operation. Each occurrence is one instance.
- **Neighbour axis**: enumerate EACH paired, adjacent, or sibling path of the
  analyzed path (and EACH other in-scope contract/function sharing the found
  pattern). Each neighbour is one instance.

If an axis genuinely generates exactly one instance for a finding (the operation
is not paired, the construct occurs once, the path has no sibling), say so
explicitly and name the single instance — that is a valid one-instance
enumeration, not a blanket pass.

## Gap-Filling Procedure

For each enumerated instance:

1. Determine whether that SPECIFIC instance is resolved — i.e. either it already
   maps to a prior finding, or your own analysis of it produces a definite
   safe/unsafe verdict grounded in the source.
2. If the instance is unsafe and not already captured by a prior finding, this
   is a GAP. Perform the missing analysis directly against the source and emit
   the result as one of: a NEW finding, an UPGRADE of an existing finding, or a
   RE-OPEN of a dismissed/downgraded finding.
3. Never emit a gap as a deletion, a merge, or a downgrade.
4. If the instance is safe (or already captured), you may record it NO-GAP — but
   ONLY with a named instance and concrete evidence (see the NO-GAP evidence
   rule below).

### NO-GAP Evidence Rule (HARD — bans the rubber-stamp)

A `NO-GAP` disposition is VALID only when its coverage-record row NAMES the
specific instance verified AND CITES concrete evidence — either the file:line
(or function) where the instance was found to be safe, or the prior finding ID
that already captures it.

A blanket `NO-GAP` that does not name the specific instance + its evidence is
PROHIBITED. Wording like "direction explored", "boundary shift explored",
"pattern explored elsewhere", or "covered somewhere" is NOT evidence — it
asserts the axis was touched, not that THIS instance was resolved. When you
cannot name the instance and cite where it was verified, the instance is by
definition UNEXPLORED: emit it as an ADD (a NEW finding or RE-OPEN) at the
inherited severity, never as a NO-GAP.

When in doubt between NO-GAP and ADD, choose ADD. This phase is additive-only;
an extra ADD is recoverable downstream, a falsely-cleared instance is a missed
vulnerability.

### Committed-Invariant Emission (ADDITIVE — for every value-bearing NO-GAP)

Whenever you record `NO-GAP` for a value-bearing instance (one touching value
movement, supply/shares, accounting, authorization, or a boundary that gates
funds/liveness), you are asserting a tacit LOCAL GUARD makes it safe. Do not
leave that guard implicit — commit it as an executable, falsifiable assertion so
the falsifier can try to break it. This is strictly additive and inherits this
phase's ADD/UPGRADE-only authority; it never drops, merges, or downgrades any
finding.

For each such `NO-GAP`, additionally emit a `committed-invariant [CI-n]` block
naming the local guard you believe makes the instance safe, expressed as exactly
ONE of the six generic SHAPES — `CONSERVATION` (Σin == Σout ± fee),
`REQUESTED_EQ_DELIVERED`, `APPROVE_EQ_SPEND`, `NO_REVERT_AT_BOUNDARY`
(min/mid/max), `ROUNDTRIP` (decode∘encode == id), `FRESHNESS` (input age ≤ bound
/ source == expected). Resolve symbols at the locus (`file:Lnn`, real
variable/function names) but NEVER bake a protocol constant as "the answer" — the
assertion is a relational shape, not a hardcoded value.

```
committed-invariant [CI-n]
Locus: <file>:L<nn>  (fn: <enclosing function>)
Shape: <one of CONSERVATION|REQUESTED_EQ_DELIVERED|APPROVE_EQ_SPEND|NO_REVERT_AT_BOUNDARY|ROUNDTRIP|FRESHNESS>
Assertion: <the falsifiable relation at the locus, symbols resolved>
Falsify Class: <property | boundary | roundtrip | conservation>
Provenance: skeptic NO-GAP @ <instance>
```

Emit one block per value-bearing NO-GAP instance. A non-value-bearing NO-GAP
(pure view, no funds/liveness effect) needs no block. These blocks are
mechanically harvested downstream into falsifiable candidates and handed to the
fuzz/PoC gates; a survived assertion sharpens the spec, a triggered one is a real
bug.

## Output Requirements

Write everything to `exploration_skeptic_findings.md`.

1. **Findings**: Every new finding, upgrade, or re-open MUST use the standard
   finding format defined in `~/.claude/rules/finding-output-format.md`. State
   clearly for each whether it is a NEW finding, an UPGRADE (and of which prior
   finding), or a RE-OPEN (and of which prior finding).

2. **Coverage Record**: Write a per-INSTANCE table. There is one ROW per
   enumerated instance, NOT one row per axis. Use exactly these columns:

   ```
   | Finding | Axis | Instance | Disposition | Evidence |
   |---------|------|----------|-------------|----------|
   ```

   - **Finding**: the input finding ID this instance derives from.
   - **Axis**: `Direction`, `Similar-Mechanism`, or `Neighbour`.
   - **Instance**: the NAMED concrete instance (e.g. the specific direction,
     the specific sibling path, the specific other occurrence). Never blank,
     never a generic axis label.
   - **Disposition**: exactly one of:
     - `ASSESSED` — this instance was already covered completely by prior analysis.
     - `GAP-FILLED` — a gap existed for this instance; the missing analysis was
       performed and emitted as a NEW finding or UPGRADE.
     - `RE-OPENED` — the instance assessment justified re-opening a
       dismissed/downgraded finding.
     - `NO-GAP` — completeness for THIS instance was confirmed with nothing to
       add (valid ONLY with named instance + evidence per the NO-GAP Evidence
       Rule above).
   - **Evidence**: for `NO-GAP` and `ASSESSED`, the concrete file:line (or
     function) where the instance was verified safe, OR the prior finding ID
     that captures it. For `GAP-FILLED`/`RE-OPENED`, the emitted finding ID. A
     `NO-GAP` row whose Evidence cell is blank, or contains only "explored" /
     "covered" / "touched"-style wording without a named locus, is a contract
     violation and will be re-surfaced downstream as an unexplored instance.

   The per-instance coverage record lets downstream gating confirm that
   completeness was audited at the INSTANCE level — every enumerated neighbour,
   direction, and sub-mechanism — not merely that each axis was touched
   somewhere.

## Method Discipline

State all methods abstractly. Your output MUST NOT contain any protocol,
project, contract, function, variable, or token names drawn from this audit as
generic methodology; describe the method, not a named instance of it. The
methodology itself encodes HOW to verify completeness, never WHAT to find in any
specific codebase. Do not import prior-audit finding IDs or file:line citations
into the methodology sections; concrete references belong only inside the
finding bodies and coverage record where they describe the current target.
