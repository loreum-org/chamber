# Phase 1: Recon Agent (DAML/Canton pipeline)

You are the Reconnaissance Agent. Your job is to gather ALL information
needed for the security audit and write it to the scratchpad. Execute
the recon orchestration plan and write the required handoff artifacts.

**CRITICAL**: Spawn only the recon workers assigned by this prompt. Do NOT ask the user
questions. Do NOT call AskUserQuestion (it is unavailable in this
context). All configuration has already been collected by the wizard
and passed to you via the placeholders below. If a placeholder is empty,
treat the corresponding input as "not provided" and continue.

**Resilience**: If any tool call (web search, daml, damlc) fails or
times out, record the failure in the relevant output file and continue
to the next task. Never retry more than once. Partial recon is better
than no recon.

**FIRST ACTION**: Run `ls {SCRATCHPAD}/` to see which artifacts already exist. DAML has **NO static-analysis pre-pass** (no SCIP indexer, no Scout/Slither, DLint is style-only), so recon is **fully read-driven** — you are the sole producer of every artifact. Draft all 11 artifacts early (see TURN BUDGET POLICY below), then enrich.

## Inputs (pre-resolved by the driver)

- **PROJECT_PATH**: {path}
- **SCRATCHPAD**: {scratchpad}
- **LANGUAGE**: {LANGUAGE}
- **MODE**: {MODE}
- **DOCUMENTATION**: {docs_path_or_url_if_provided}
- **NETWORK**: {network_if_provided}
- **SCOPE_FILE**: {scope_file_if_provided}
- **SCOPE_NOTES**: {scope_notes_if_provided}

## RESILIENCE RULES (apply to ALL tasks)

1. **External tool fails/times out?** -> Document the failure and CONTINUE. Never retry more than once.
2. **Web search fails?** -> Note "UNAVAILABLE - web search failed" and CONTINUE.
3. **Write-first principle**: Write partial results before slow external calls.
4. **No task is blocking**: Skip stuck tasks, document why, move on.
5. **Task-local writes are mandatory**: As soon as you finish one assigned task, write its output file immediately before moving to the next.
6. **No pre-pass for DAML**: There is no mechanical `recon_prepass.py` coverage for DAML. Do NOT wait for or assume pre-written drafts beyond a possible empty stub — grep over `.daml` is your always-available fallback, `damlc inspect-dar --json` is the structural oracle supplement.

## TURN BUDGET POLICY - DRAFT-FIRST, ENRICH-LATER (MANDATORY)

You run inside `claude -p` with a hard **--max-turns cap** (currently 80
for recon) and a **--wall-clock timeout** (1500s for small projects,
auto-scaled by the driver for larger ones). A single Read/Bash/Grep/Write
call costs ONE turn. Large codebases (many `.daml` modules, multiple
packages) can consume 50+ turns on exploration alone. If you hit the cap
or timeout without writing the required artifacts, the driver's gate fails
and the whole pipeline aborts.

**Rule**: In the FIRST 5—10 turns, write SUBSTANTIVE DRAFTS of ALL 11
required artifacts. DAML has no mechanical pre-pass, so YOU draft every
one — check with `ls {SCRATCHPAD}/` FIRST and overwrite any empty stub.
After drafts exist, spend remaining turns enriching them.

The 11 required artifacts (gate will reject if any is missing):

| File | Status check | Minimum-valid-draft content |
|---|---|---|
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md` | LLM writes | `# Design Context (draft)\n- Project: best-known target\n- Language: DAML (Canton ledger)\n- Key Invariants: best-known findings so far\n- Operational Implications: best-known findings so far\n` |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/contract_inventory.md` | LLM writes | `# Contract Inventory (draft)\n- Templates enumerated during enrichment\n` |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_variables.md` | LLM writes | `# State / Template Fields (draft)\n- (Template T, field f) pairs enumerated during enrichment\n` |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md` | LLM writes | `# Choice List (draft)\n- Template choices + consume-mode + controller enumerated during enrichment\n` |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md` | LLM writes | `# Attack Surface (draft)\n- Sections A-F enumerated during enrichment\n` |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/template_recommendations.md` | LLM writes | Full BINDING MANIFEST scaffold; LLM flips Required â†’ **YES** for triggered skills |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/detected_patterns.md` | LLM writes | `# Detected Patterns (draft)` plus the complete DAML flag table with best-effort YES/NO defaults |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/setter_list.md` | LLM writes | `# Setter List (draft)` plus discovered mutating/config/whitelist choices (Permissionless State-Modifiers section) |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/emit_list.md` | LLM writes | `# Disclosure List (draft)` plus observer/stakeholder + interface-view exposure inventory (DAML has no events) |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/build_status.md` | LLM writes | `daml build` result + `.dar` path + SDK version + damlc availability + DAML-Script runner availability + Chosen build root |
| `{SCRATCHPAD}/recon_summary.md` | LLM writes last | `# Recon Summary (draft)\n- Target: best-known target\n- Language: DAML\n- Skills to load: best-known skill list\n` |

**Recommended turn budget (target, not hard rule):**

| Turns | Activity |
|---|---|
| 1—2  | `ls {SCRATCHPAD}/` + top-level project inspection (daml.yaml, README.md, daml-sdk version, dependencies) |
| 3—8  | Draft ALL 11 artifacts (Write tool, one per turn) |
| 9—25 | Enrich design_context.md (deepest artifact) from docs + key templates |
| 26—45 | Enrich template_recommendations.md with triggered skills based on attack surface |
| 46—60 | Enrich attack_surface.md (per-template AUTHORIZATION MATRIX), state_variables.md, contract_inventory.md |
| 61—80 | Final pass: rewrite recon_summary.md with real content; overwrite drafts where you have enrichment |

If you reach turn 70 and have not re-written all artifacts with real
content, STOP exploration and overwrite the remaining drafts with
whatever you have. Partial real content beats "perfect analysis that
never lands on disk."

**Do NOT spend more than 5 turns on any single file exploration**. If
grep returns more than you can read, write a summary + "deferred" note
to the draft and move on.

## CLEAN HANDOFF CONTRACT (MANDATORY)

Draft-first is a crash-recovery tactic, not a pass condition. Before returning
`RECON COMPLETE`, re-open every required recon artifact and replace all draft-only,
placeholder, `best-known target`, `[LLM TO ...]`, `TODO`, and "explicitly unavailable after bounded inspection"
markers with the best real content available.

If time or turn budget is nearly exhausted, stop exploration immediately and
write a minimal substantive final version of `recon_summary.md` and
`build_status.md` before any other work:
- `recon_summary.md` must name the target, language, scope, key components,
  detected patterns, recommended templates, and artifact list.
- `build_status.md` must record the actual build/inspect command(s),
  result, failure/unavailable reason when applicable, and fallback used.

Do not return `RECON COMPLETE` while any required artifact is still draft-only.
If an artifact remains incomplete, say `RECON INCOMPLETE` and list the exact
files still needing enrichment; the driver will retry recon instead of letting
a dirty handoff poison instantiate/breadth.

Execute these tasks IN ORDER:

## TASK 0: RAG Meta-Buffer (DEFERRED)

RAG vulnerability-database research is deferred to Phase 4b.5 (RAG
Validation Sweep), which runs after depth analysis. That phase has its
own MCP + WebSearch fallback path.

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/meta_buffer.md`:

```
# Meta-Buffer

## RAG: DEFERRED to Phase 4b.5

Recon does not perform RAG queries in the V2 driver. Phase 4b.5 RAG
Validation Sweep will populate this file with per-finding RAG scores
after depth analysis completes.
```

Continue to TASK 0.5 (Fork Ancestry) and then TASK 1.

## TASK 0.5: Fork Ancestry Research -- DAML Parent Libraries

Read ~/.claude/agents/skills/daml/fork-ancestry/SKILL.md if it exists, otherwise apply this methodology:

DAML fork-ancestry is reduced to a **one-line recon note** (generic mechanism + one illustrative library; NO overfit to any named protocol). The only goal is to detect when the package reuses a well-known DAML asset/standard library so depth can inherit its known divergence questions.

### Generic DAML parent-library detection

| Signal | Detection mechanism |
|--------|--------------------|
| Shared asset/standard library reuse | Grep imports for a published DAML model library (illustrative example: a `Daml.Finance.*`-style asset/holding/settlement module set); check `daml.yaml` `dependencies:` / `data-dependencies:` for a `.dar` named after a common library |
| Generic common-lib reuse | Grep imports for shared utility modules pulled from a `data-dependencies` DAR rather than defined in-tree |

**Detection**: 1) Grep `.daml` imports for library module prefixes, 2) Check `daml.yaml` `dependencies`/`data-dependencies` for external `.dar` names, 3) Check README for reuse attribution, 4) Compare template/choice names against the imported library surface.

**For each detected parent library**: note the library name + the divergences (modified controller clauses, changed signatory/maintainer sets, added/removed choices, altered `ensure` clauses, changed key schemas). Append a single `## Fork Ancestry Analysis` line to {SCRATCHPAD}/meta_buffer.md. Do NOT write a compliance essay.

> **SKIP POLICY**: If web searches fail, write 'Fork ancestry: web search unavailable' and continue with code-level divergence analysis only.

## TASK 1: Build Environment

> **PATH note**: On Windows, `daml` and `damlc` may not be in Claude Code's default PATH. Prefix Bash calls with: `export PATH="$HOME/.daml/bin:$HOME/AppData/Roaming/daml/bin:$PATH" &&` if not found on first attempt. The DAML runtime is JVM-based — a JDK must be present.

1. Check for `daml.yaml` (project manifest) with `sdk-version`, `dependencies`, `data-dependencies`, `source`, and a `name`/`version`. Also check for `.daml/` build cache directory.
1b. Verify toolchain availability before building:
   - `daml version` -- if missing, document as TOOLCHAIN WARNING
   - `damlc version` (or `daml damlc --version`) -- required for the structural oracle
   - `java -version` -- DAML runtime is JVM-based; if missing, document JDK_MISSING
   If any required tool is missing, document in build_status.md and attempt build anyway.
1c. **NO Overflow-Check Gate** (DAML difference): DAML `Int` and `Decimal` **throw on overflow** (they do NOT silently wrap). Integer overflow in DAML is therefore a **liveness/brick** issue (the choice aborts and the contract becomes un-exercisable), NOT a silent-correctness issue. Do NOT look for an `overflow-checks` profile flag — it does not exist. Instead, every arithmetic site is routed to the **BOUNDARY/INVARIANT** vuln class (reachable `abort`). Record `OVERFLOW_MODEL: throws-on-overflow (liveness, not silent-wrap)` in build_status.md.
1d. **Dependency Recovery** (before first build attempt):
   - Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   - Ensure `daml.yaml` `dependencies`/`data-dependencies` `.dar` files exist on disk (they must be pre-fetched; DAML does not auto-download arbitrary deps).
1e. **Compilation Weight Check** (before first build attempt):
   Count total `.daml` files (excluding `.daml/` build cache): use Glob to find all *.daml files outside `.daml/`.
   Count packages: each directory owning a `daml.yaml` is one package.
   Assess compilation weight:
   - **HEAVY** (any of: >200 `.daml` files, >3 packages, multiple `daml.yaml` roots): Record `COMPILE_WEIGHT: heavy` in build_status.md.
   - **MODERATE** (100-200 `.daml` files): Record `COMPILE_WEIGHT: moderate`.
   - **LIGHT** (<100 files): Record `COMPILE_WEIGHT: light`.
2. Build: `daml build` (produces `.daml/dist/{name}-{version}.dar`). On failure, document the error and continue — grep over `.daml` remains the fallback structural source.
3. **Structural oracle (the SCIP/Scout replacement)**: once a `.dar` exists, run `damlc inspect-dar .daml/dist/*.dar --json 2>/dev/null > {SCRATCHPAD}/inspect_dar.json`. This is the deterministic full template/choice/key/interface surface. If `--json` fails, try `damlc inspect-dar .daml/dist/*.dar 2>&1 | head -500`. If `damlc` is unavailable, mark `DAMLC_AVAILABLE: false` and fall back to grep (TASK 2).
4. Check `daml.yaml` for:
   - `sdk-version` -- note for known issue cross-reference
   - `dependencies` / `data-dependencies` -- external `.dar` packages (cross-package surface)
5. If build fails after 3 attempts, document failure and continue.

Also run: `git rev-list --count HEAD` -- if result is 1, include `REPO_SHAPE: squashed_import`, otherwise `REPO_SHAPE: normal_dev`. This tells FORK_ANCESTRY whether git history analysis is useful.

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/build_status.md:
```markdown
# Build Status
- **Framework**: DAML SDK {sdk-version from daml.yaml}
- **daml CLI**: {version or MISSING}
- **damlc (structural oracle)**: DAMLC_AVAILABLE: {true/false}
- **Java/JDK**: {version or JDK_MISSING}
- **Build Result**: success/failed ({error})
- **.dar Path**: {path to .daml/dist/*.dar or NONE}
- **OVERFLOW_MODEL**: throws-on-overflow (liveness, not silent-wrap)
- **DAML-Script runner**: DAML_SCRIPT_AVAILABLE: {true/false} (set in TASK 9)
- **damlc inspect-dar oracle**: {captured to inspect_dar.json / unavailable}
- **RAG_TOOLS_AVAILABLE**: {true/false} (set by earlier probe)
- **COMPILE_WEIGHT**: light/moderate/heavy
```

**MANDATORY — Chosen build root**: the audit scope dir is often source-only;
the real `daml.yaml` package root frequently lives in a sibling or
ancestor directory. After resolving where the build actually compiled, emit
EXACTLY this line into `build_status.md` (the mechanical PoC executor parses
it verbatim): `**Chosen build root**: ` followed by the absolute path of the
directory that owns `daml.yaml`, wrapped in backticks — e.g.
`` **Chosen build root**: `/abs/path/to/package` ``. If no build environment
exists at all, emit `` **Chosen build root**: `(none)` ``.

## TASK 2: Structural Inventory (grep PRIMARY, damlc supplements)

> DAML inverts the Soroban rule: grep is the always-available **PRIMARY** method; `damlc inspect-dar --json` is the **supplement** when the SDK is present. Extract everything below from `.daml` source; cross-check counts against `inspect_dar.json` if it exists.

**Template inventory** (the unit of analysis):
- Grep `^template ` in `.daml` files under the source dir (exclude `.daml/` cache, test/script-only modules where possible)
- For each template, capture: `signatory` clause, `observer` clause, `key`/`maintainer` clause (if any), `ensure` clause (if any), `implements`/interface instances
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/contract_inventory.md (one row per template)

**State-field inventory** (the `(Template, field)` model):
- For each template, list its record fields as `Template.field : Type`
- Tag each field's role: party? `ContractId`? amount/accumulator? config/whitelist CID? lock/flag? deadline/time?
- Note which choices read (`fetch`/`lookupByKey`/branch-on) and which choices write (`create`/`archive`) each field
- Keys + maintainers = uniqueness state
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/state_variables.md

**Choice inventory** (the entrypoints):
- Grep `choice ` / `controller ` / `nonconsuming choice ` / `preconsuming choice ` / `postconsuming choice `
- For each choice `Template.Choice`: consume-mode (consuming/nonconsuming/preconsuming/postconsuming), controller expr, return type
- CRITICAL: mark whether the controller is a **fixed signatory** vs **argument-derived** (a controller computed from a choice argument is a privilege-injection signal — `[ELEVATE:PARAM_CONTROLLER]`)
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md

**Choice-consequence graph** (the one-hop authority map):
- For each choice, grep its body for `create `, `archive `, `exercise `, `exerciseByKey `, `fetch `, `fetchByKey `, `lookupByKey `
- This is DAML's "cross-contract call graph": a choice exercising another template's choice in its consequences (authority propagates exactly one hop)
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/call_graph.md

**Authorization sites** (modifiers equivalent):
- Grep `controller `, `signatory `, `ensure `, in-body `assertMsg`/`assert `/`require`/`==`-on-party checks (`owner == party`)
- Note which choices have an in-body authorization check vs rely solely on the controller clause
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/modifiers.md

**Interfaces & CID coercion**: Grep `interface `, `viewtype `, `fromInterfaceContractId`, `toInterfaceContractId`, `coerceContractId` -> {SCRATCHPAD}/external_interfaces.md

**Disclosure surface** (events repurposed): Grep `observer `, `interface ` `view`, choice-level `observer` additions -> note what each template exposes to which parties. (DAML has no events; this is the disclosure/visibility surface.)

## TASK 3: Documentation Context

1. Read README.md, docs/ folder, or fetch provided URL
2. Extract: protocol purpose, key invariants, party trust model, external package dependencies (`data-dependencies`)
3. Identify: party/authority model (which parties are signatories/controllers; is there an operator/admin party?), value-conservation invariants (across split/merge/transfer), locking model, accumulator/cap invariants, key uniqueness model, interface exposure
4. If no docs: note 'Inferring purpose from code'
5. **Operational Implications** (MANDATORY gate, same as Soroban): Immediately after documenting Key Invariants, add a subsection to design_context.md:

```
## Operational Implications
State what each invariant means for how the system works -- not what it checks,
but what it tells you about the system's accounting model.
Derive these from the invariant formulas and the template record definitions in the code.
Each implication must reference specific template field signatures or formula
components -- restating the invariant in different words is not an implication.
```

6. **Party Trust Table** (MANDATORY): From ASSUMPTIONS.txt, docs, README, code comments, and authorization patterns (`signatory`/`controller`/`maintainer`), extract ALL party trust assumptions into a structured table in design_context.md:

| # | Party / Role | Trust Level | Assumption | Source |
|---|--------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | {party role} | FULLY_TRUSTED | Will not act maliciously | {source} |
| 2 | {party role} | SEMI_TRUSTED(bounds: {on-ledger limit}) | Cannot exceed {stated bounds} | {source} |
| 3 | - | PRECONDITION | {config state assumed at allocation} | {source} |

Trust levels: `FULLY_TRUSTED` (will not act maliciously - e.g., operator/admin party, governance party), `SEMI_TRUSTED(bounds: ...)` (bounded by on-ledger constraints), `PRECONDITION` (deployment/config state assumption), `UNTRUSTED` (default for counterparty/user parties, external packages).
If no explicit trust documentation exists, infer from signatory/controller/maintainer patterns, and note `Source: inferred`. **No compliance/identity/JWT prose.**

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md

## TASK 4: Template Inventory

1. Count lines for all `.daml` files in the source dir (exclude `.daml/` cache)
2. List each template with: file:line, LOC, #choices, #signatories, #observers, has-key (Y/N), implements-interface list
3. List interface definitions and DAML-Script test modules separately
4. List helper/utility modules and shared types
5. **Scope filtering**: If SCOPE_FILE is set, read it and mark templates as IN_SCOPE or OUT_OF_SCOPE. If SCOPE_NOTES is set, use them to refine scope. If neither is set, all templates are in scope.

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/contract_inventory.md (enrich the TASK 2 draft)

## TASK 5: Attack Surface Discovery

Write all six sections to {SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md.

### Part A: Per-Template AUTHORIZATION MATRIX (the single biggest recall lever)

For EACH template, build a parties × actions matrix (computed cheaply by read-only analysis so depth inherits a ground-truth map):

| Template | Party / Role | Can Create? | Can Exercise {Choice}? | Can Archive? | Can See (stakeholder)? |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|

- Create requires ALL `signatory` parties' authority.
- Exercise {Choice} requires ALL listed `controller` parties' authority (AND-joined).
- Archive requires `signatory` authority.
- See = signatory ∪ observer (∪ divulgees via shared-tx fetch).
- Tag: `[ELEVATE:PARAM_CONTROLLER]` if any choice's controller is derived from a choice argument; `[ELEVATE:MISSING_COAUTH]` if a value-moving/state-changing choice has a single controller where a joint (multi-party) authorization would be expected (single-where-joint).

### Part B: Choice / Asset Semantics

| Choice | Consume-Mode | Moves Value? | Splits/Merges/Transfers? | Touches Locked Asset? | Notes |

- Flag consuming-vs-nonconsuming misuse on value-movers; pre/postconsuming self-`fetch`-after-archive; locked-asset still split/merge/transferred; value-conservation across split/merge/transfer; accumulator/cap tracked across txns; cancel/abort no-unwind.
- Tags: `[ELEVATE:NONCONSUMING_REPLAY]` (nonconsuming choice that should archive → double-exercise), `[ELEVATE:VALUE_CONSERVATION]` (split/merge/transfer where out ≠ in), `[ELEVATE:LOCK_BYPASS]` (locked asset mutated).

### Part C: CID-Capability (DAML-distinctive)

| Site | Caller-Supplied ContractId? | Bound to Operation? | Config/Whitelist CID? | Hardcoded/Stale? | Notes |

- Flag caller-supplied `ContractId` not bound to the operation; missing config/whitelist CID → **fail-open**; hardcoded/stale config CID → **brick**; wrong-CID/type confusion (`fromInterfaceContractId` coercion).
- Tags: `[ELEVATE:CID_BINDING]`, `[ELEVATE:FAIL_OPEN]`, `[ELEVATE:CID_BRICK]`.

### Part D: Key / State Lifecycle

| Template (keyed) | Key Fields | Maintainers ⊆ Signatories? | lookupByKey Used? | None-Branch Behavior | Notes |

- Flag `lookupByKey` **false-None** (None = "not visible" ≠ "absent"); `exerciseByKey`/maintainer-authority gaps (maintainer must be a signatory); stale state / missing cleanup.
- Tag: `[ELEVATE:LOOKUP_FALSE_NONE]`.

### Part E: Privacy / Disclosure (DAML-distinctive)

| Template | Signatories | Observers | Divulgence via fetch-in-shared-tx? | Interface view exposes? | Notes |

- Flag over-broad `observer`; divulgence via `fetch`-in-shared-tx; interface `view` over-exposure. Reportable **only** with a party-scoped `query@T party` PoC steer.
- Tags: `[ELEVATE:DIVULGENCE]`, `[ELEVATE:OBSERVER_BROAD]`.

### Part F: Boundary / Invariant

| Site | ensure Present? | Arithmetic (Int/Decimal)? | Deadline Enforced? | Notes |

- Flag `ensure`-clause gaps (invalid contract creatable); arithmetic overflow → **abort/brick** (DAML throws — liveness bug, not silent wrap); deadline never enforced; accumulator/cap not tracked across txns.
- Tags: `[ELEVATE:ENSURE_GAP]`, `[ELEVATE:DEADLINE_UNENFORCED]`.

### Signal Elevation Tags

Write `[ELEVATE]` tags directly into the relevant section above. Each tag = a one-line follow-up that the inventory phase must address or push to `depth_candidates.md`.

## TASK 6: Pattern Detection

Grep in `.daml` source files (exclude `.daml/` cache):

| Pattern | Flag |
|---------|------|
| 2+ parties in any `signatory` clause | MULTI_SIGNATORY |
| `controller` expression referencing a choice argument (not a fixed signatory field) | PARAM_CONTROLLER (HIGH) |
| `nonconsuming choice ` | NONCONSUMING_CHOICE |
| field/template named `lock`/`Lock`/`locked`/`Locked` or a lock/unlock choice pair | LOCKING |
| `Decimal`/amount/`balance`/`quantity` fields moved by choices | VALUE_BEARING |
| accumulator/`total`/`sum`/`cap`/`limit` field updated across choices | ACCUMULATOR_CAP |
| `ContractId ` as a choice argument type | CID_CAPABILITY |
| `key `/`maintainer ` clause present | CONTRACT_KEY |
| broad `observer ` (party set wider than signatories) or `fetch`-in-shared-tx | DIVULGENCE_RISK |
| `interface `/`viewtype `/`implements ` | INTERFACE |
| `ensure ` clause present | ENSURE_PRESENT (absence on value-bearing template → ENSURE_GAP) |
| `getTime`/deadline/`expiry`/`maturity` field or `assert` against time | DEADLINE |
| `Propose`/`Accept`/`Offer`/`Request` template+choice pairs | MULTI_STEP_OPS |
| `data-dependencies` in daml.yaml referencing an external `.dar` | NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL |
| `exercise`/`exerciseByKey`/`fetch` targeting a `ContractId`/interface whose implementing template has NO in-repo `template` definition (only imported via `data-dependencies` in daml.yaml), AND whose choice return value or fetched field is consumed (bound in a `do` block, branched on, or used to update a value-bearing field) | EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY (alias: also sets NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL for back-compat) |
| `fromInterfaceContractId`/`coerceContractId` | INTERFACE_COERCION |
| 2+ in-scope templates sharing a field/formula/key | HAS_MULTI_TEMPLATE |
| DOCUMENTATION non-empty with testable claims | HAS_DOCS |
| `split`/`merge`/`transfer` + share/allocation/`pro-rata` | SHARE_ALLOCATION |
| fee/rate/cap/emission/`multiplier` as a template field | MONETARY_PARAMETER |
| operator/admin/owner party as a signatory/controller | SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLE |

**`EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY` is a GENERIC, non-brand mechanical trigger** — the row
above (`NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL`) only fires on the presence of ANY
`data-dependencies` entry and does not distinguish which imported template's
choices are actually consumed. The test here is structural, never a name: (a)
no in-repo template implementation, (b) the choice result / fetched field is
consumed. Every dependency that sets EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY or
NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL gets a row in the External Dependency Research Ledger
in TASK 11 below.

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/detected_patterns.md

## TASK 7: Prep Artifacts

**Mutating/config/whitelist choices**: Grep choices that `create`/`archive` config, whitelist, flag, or parameter templates; admin/operator-party controller checks
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/setter_list.md (include '## Permissionless State-Modifiers' section = choices with a non-privileged OR argument-derived controller)

**Disclosure list** (events repurposed — DAML has no events): For each template, list observers + interface `view` exposures + choice-level observer additions. Cross-reference: for each state-changing choice, note who becomes a stakeholder/divulgee as a result. Flag OVER-BROAD disclosures.
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/emit_list.md
> Filename kept as `emit_list.md` so the EVENT_COMPLETENESS niche slot + driver gate stay wired; the semantic content is the disclosure/visibility surface.

**Constraint variables**: Grep `min`/`max`/`cap`/`limit`/`rate`/`fee`/`threshold`/`factor`/`multiplier`/`ratio`/`weight`/`duration`/`delay`/`period`/`decimal`/`precision` in template fields and `ensure` clauses. Mark UNENFORCED for limits with no `ensure` guard.
Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/constraint_variables.md

## TASK 8: Run Targeted Grep "Detectors"

> DAML has no security SAST (Scout/Slither/SCIP do not exist; DLint is style-only). This task replaces the Scout supplement with disciplined grep "detectors". Set `SAST_AVAILABLE: false` in build_status.md.

Run targeted grep checks for DAML-specific vulnerability patterns:

**Authorization**:
- Choice with a `controller` derived from a choice argument → PARAM_CONTROLLER_AUTH (HIGH — privilege injection)
- Value-moving/state-changing choice with a single controller where joint authority is expected → MISSING_COAUTH
- Choice body that branches on a `fetch`ed contract's field as an authorization decision → FETCH_BASED_AUTH (a fetched contract can be forgeable/attacker-chosen)
- Choice missing an in-body `owner == party`-style ownership validation → MISSING_BODY_VALIDATION

**Choice / Asset semantics**:
- `nonconsuming choice` that moves value or should be one-shot → NONCONSUMING_REPLAY (double-exercise)
- `preconsuming`/`postconsuming` choice that `fetch`es `self` after archive → SELF_FETCH_AFTER_ARCHIVE
- split/merge/transfer where output amounts are not asserted to equal input → VALUE_CONSERVATION_GAP
- accumulator/cap field not re-checked across separate transactions → CAP_NOT_TRACKED

**CID-Capability**:
- `ContractId` choice argument used without re-`fetch`/re-validation binding it to the operation → CID_NOT_BOUND
- config/whitelist `ContractId` absent → fail-open default branch → FAIL_OPEN
- hardcoded/stale config `ContractId` that cannot be updated → CID_BRICK
- `fromInterfaceContractId`/`coerceContractId` without verifying the underlying template → CID_TYPE_CONFUSION

**State / Key lifecycle**:
- `lookupByKey` whose `None` branch assumes "absent" (None can mean "not visible to this party") → LOOKUP_FALSE_NONE
- `key`/`maintainer` where a maintainer is NOT a signatory → MAINTAINER_NOT_SIGNATORY
- `exerciseByKey` without confirming the caller can resolve the key → EXERCISE_BY_KEY_GAP
- stale keyed contract never archived/cleaned up → STALE_KEY

**Boundary / Invariant**:
- value-bearing template with NO `ensure` clause (invalid contract creatable) → ENSURE_GAP
- `Int`/`Decimal` arithmetic on user-influenced values reachable without bound → ARITHMETIC_ABORT (liveness/brick)
- deadline/`getTime` field never asserted in any choice → DEADLINE_UNENFORCED

**Privacy / Disclosure**:
- `observer` party set wider than functionally necessary → OBSERVER_BROAD
- `fetch`-in-shared-tx that incidentally divulges a private contract → DIVULGENCE

## TASK 9: Run Test Suite / Prove PoC Harness

- Run: `daml test 2>&1 | tail -100` (runs every in-scope `Script ()` in the project; there is NO per-test name filter — isolation is file-scoped via `daml test --files <File>`).
- If that fails: document the error and try `daml build` alone to confirm compilation.
- Confirm the DAML-Script runner is live (so depth/verify can rely on `submit`/`submitMustFail`/`query@T`/`allocateParty`). Set `DAML_SCRIPT_AVAILABLE: true/false` in build_status.md.
- Note coverage quality: are auth-bypass attempts (`submitMustFail`) tested? double-exercise? key-None? value-conservation?
- **Reachable-abort note**: If `daml test` surfaces a `PreconditionFailed`/`abort` on a path that is NOT one of the suite's own `submitMustFail` negative cases, record it as a candidate `[DT-n]` reachable-abort (BOUNDARY class) for inventory — but FILTER OUT the suite's intentional must-fail cases.
If tests fail, note as TEST HEALTH WARNING.

## TASK 10: Template Recommendations

### DAML-Specific Skills (in ~/.claude/agents/skills/daml/ -- create as needed)
- AUTHORIZATION_MODEL -- **ALWAYS required** (controller/signatory coverage, controller-from-argument trace, body-validation, guard/whitelist bypass, fetch-auth)
- CHOICE_SEMANTICS -- **ALWAYS required** (consuming-class correctness, pre/post ordering, successor-state completeness, cancel/abort-unwind)
- CID_CAPABILITY_SAFETY -- **ALWAYS required** (caller-supplied-CID binding, fail-open config, stale brick, type-confusion)
- CONTRACT_KEY_SAFETY -- **ALWAYS required** (maintainer ⊆ signatory, lookupByKey false-None, exerciseByKey authority, stale cleanup)
- INTERFACE_SAFETY -- **ALWAYS required** (fromInterfaceContractId coercion, interface-choice controller, view over-exposure)
- PRIVACY_DISCLOSURE -- **ALWAYS required** (stakeholder-set, divulgence-via-fetch, interface-view exposure; PoC = party-scoped query@T)
- BOUNDARY_INVARIANT -- **ALWAYS required** (ensure-gap, arithmetic abort/brick, deadline enforcement; PoC = boundary-value Scripts)

### Shared Templates (in ~/.claude/agents/skills/ -- use DAML-adapted versions)
- VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL -- **ALWAYS required** (verifiers)
- FORK_ANCESTRY -- **ALWAYS required** (one-line note for DAML)
- SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLES (SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLE flag), SHARE_ALLOCATION_FAIRNESS (SHARE_ALLOCATION flag), TEMPORAL_PARAMETER_STALENESS (DEADLINE flag), ECONOMIC_DESIGN_AUDIT (MONETARY_PARAMETER flag)

For EACH recommended template provide: Trigger, Relevance, Instantiation Parameters, Key Questions.

## BINDING MANIFEST (MANDATORY)

> **CRITICAL**: Orchestrator MUST spawn an agent for every template marked `Required: YES`.

```markdown
## BINDING MANIFEST

| Template | Pattern Trigger | Required? | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| AUTHORIZATION_MODEL | Always (DAML) | YES | Foundational DAML security -- controller/signatory authority + privilege injection |
| CHOICE_SEMANTICS | Always (DAML) | YES | Consume-mode correctness -- double-spend / ordering / unwind |
| CID_CAPABILITY_SAFETY | Always (DAML) | YES | Caller-supplied ContractId binding / fail-open / brick / type-confusion |
| CONTRACT_KEY_SAFETY | Always (DAML) | YES | maintainer ⊆ signatory, lookupByKey false-None, exerciseByKey authority |
| INTERFACE_SAFETY | Always (DAML) | YES | fromInterfaceContractId coercion, interface-choice controller, view exposure |
| PRIVACY_DISCLOSURE | Always (DAML) | YES | observer/divulgence/view exposure (party-scoped query@T PoC) |
| BOUNDARY_INVARIANT | Always (DAML) | YES | ensure-gap, arithmetic abort/brick, deadline enforcement |
| VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL | Always (verifiers) | YES | PoC evidence discipline |
| FORK_ANCESTRY | Always | YES | Historical library-divergence inheritance (one-line note) |
| SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLES | SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLE flag | {YES/NO} | {operator/admin party as signatory/controller} |
| SHARE_ALLOCATION_FAIRNESS | SHARE_ALLOCATION flag | {YES/NO} | {split/merge rounding + first/last-holder fairness} |
| TEMPORAL_PARAMETER_STALENESS | DEADLINE flag | {YES/NO} | {getTime/deadline staleness} |
| ECONOMIC_DESIGN_AUDIT | MONETARY_PARAMETER flag | {YES/NO} | {fee/rate/cap/emission template fields} |

### Binding Rules
- AUTHORIZATION_MODEL, CHOICE_SEMANTICS, CID_CAPABILITY_SAFETY, CONTRACT_KEY_SAFETY, INTERFACE_SAFETY, PRIVACY_DISCLOSURE, BOUNDARY_INVARIANT **ALWAYS REQUIRED** for DAML contracts
- VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL **ALWAYS REQUIRED** (verifiers)
- FORK_ANCESTRY **ALWAYS REQUIRED**
- SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLE flag → SEMI_TRUSTED_ROLES **REQUIRED**
- SHARE_ALLOCATION flag → SHARE_ALLOCATION_FAIRNESS **REQUIRED**
- DEADLINE flag → TEMPORAL_PARAMETER_STALENESS **REQUIRED**
- MONETARY_PARAMETER flag → ECONOMIC_DESIGN_AUDIT **REQUIRED**

### Niche Agent Binding Rules
- MULTI_STEP_OPS flag detected (Propose/Accept/Offer/Request template+choice pairs) → MULTI_STEP_OPERATION_SAFETY **niche agent** REQUIRED (re-scoped to PROPOSE_ACCEPT: accept re-reading mutable state the proposer signed against, propose acceptable under different terms, non-revocable propose)
- DOCUMENTATION non-empty AND contains testable protocol claims (fee structures, thresholds, permissions, distribution logic) → SPEC_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT **niche agent** REQUIRED (set `HAS_DOCS` flag; emit a finding ONLY when a doc mismatch is exploitable)
- HAS_MULTI_TEMPLATE flag detected (2+ in-scope templates sharing parameters/formulas/keys) → SEMANTIC_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT **niche agent** REQUIRED
- DIVULGENCE_RISK flag detected (over-broad observer / divulgence-via-fetch) → PRIVACY_DISCLOSURE **niche agent** REQUIRED (repurposes the EVENT_COMPLETENESS slot via emit_list.md; reportable ONLY with a party-scoped query@T PoC steer)

### Niche Agents (Phase 4b - standalone focused agents, 1 budget slot each)

| Niche Agent | Trigger | Required? | Reason |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| MULTI_STEP_OPERATION_SAFETY | MULTI_STEP_OPS flag (Propose/Accept pairs) | {YES/NO} | {if YES: propose-accept patterns found} |
| SPEC_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT | HAS_DOCS flag (non-empty DOCUMENTATION with testable claims) | {YES/NO} | {if YES: docs contain testable claims} |
| SEMANTIC_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT | HAS_MULTI_TEMPLATE flag (2+ templates sharing parameters/formulas) | {YES/NO} | {if YES: N shared parameters/formulas across M templates} |
| PRIVACY_DISCLOSURE | DIVULGENCE_RISK flag (over-broad observer / divulgence-via-fetch) | {YES/NO} | {if YES: over-broad disclosure surface found; party-scoped query@T PoC required} |

### Manifest Summary
- **Total Required Breadth Agents**: {count of YES in skill templates}
- **Total Required Niche Agents**: {count of YES in niche agents}
- **Total Optional Agents**: {count of NO with recommendation}
- **HARD GATE**: Orchestrator MUST spawn agent for each REQUIRED template AND each REQUIRED niche agent

## TASK 11: External Package Verification (MANDATORY)

> **SKIP POLICY**: If web/Tavily calls fail, skip that step, document 'UNAVAILABLE', and continue. DAML has no on-chain addresses — all external deps are cross-package `data-dependencies` + interface instances, marked UNVERIFIED.

For EACH external package the protocol depends on via `daml.yaml` `data-dependencies` or interface instances:

1. **Find the dependency**: Read `daml.yaml` `dependencies`/`data-dependencies`; list each external `.dar` and the imported module/template/interface surface.
2. **Verify identity**: Cross-reference against any well-known published DAML library (generic mechanism — note the library name + version if identifiable; do NOT name a specific protocol as a check-for hint).
3. **Interface instances**: For each `interface` the protocol implements OR consumes, note the `view` it exposes and which choices it inherits — over-exposure / wrong-controller risk.
4. **CID coercion sites**: For each `fromInterfaceContractId`/`coerceContractId`, document whether the underlying template is verified before use (type-confusion risk).
5. **Document unknown packages**: Cross-package surfaces not identifiable as well-known libraries — mark as UNVERIFIED. Search Tavily for audit history -- **skip if fails**.
6. **Mark all external deps UNVERIFIED** (no on-chain addresses to confirm): add severity note (Rule 4 adversarial assumption), set severity floor MEDIUM for HIGH worst-case where a cross-package call's behavior is unknown.

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/external_production_behavior.md

### External Dependency Research Ledger (MANDATORY)

You are the ONLY phase with both live Tavily/WebSearch/WebFetch AND full
attack-surface knowledge of every cross-package `data-dependencies` surface.
depth-phase workers run with `--disallowedTools mcp__*` and no live web
tools — they can only READ the ledger you bake here. Do the research now,
not later.

For EVERY dependency flagged `NAMED_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL` or `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY`
in TASK 6 (named or generic), write one row to
`{SCRATCHPAD}/external_dependency_research.md`:

| Dependency | Integration Surface | Assumed Behavior | Real Behavior | Source | Conformance | Fetch Status |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|

- **Dependency**: `.dar`/library name (or a short descriptive label for a
  generic/unidentified external dependency).
- **Integration Surface**: ALL `exercise`/`exerciseByKey`/`fetch` call sites,
  `file:line`, comma-separated.
- **Assumed Behavior**: what the calling code assumes, as coded.
- **Real Behavior**: researched real semantics (Tavily/WebSearch/WebFetch —
  official docs, library release notes, audit reports).
- **Source**: URL + fetch date (`fetched {DATE}`), or `UNVERIFIED: no
  on-chain address to confirm`.
- **Conformance**: `MATCH` / `MISMATCH` (flag for depth) / `CHECK`.
- **Fetch Status**: `OK`, or `FETCH_FAILED:{reason}`.

**Never drop a row.** A failed lookup still gets a row with `Fetch Status:
FETCH_FAILED:{reason}` and `Conformance: CHECK` — carried forward, never
silently omitted.

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/external_dependency_research.md`. If NO dependencies
were flagged in TASK 6, still write the file with only the header row.

```

Return: 'RECON COMPLETE: {T} templates, {C} choices, {K} keyed, {I} interfaces, flags: [...]'

SCOPE: Write ONLY to the scratchpad files described above. Do NOT spawn subagents.
Do NOT proceed to subsequent pipeline phases (breadth, depth, verification, report).
Return your findings and stop.
