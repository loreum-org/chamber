# Phase 4a Inventory Agent (DAML)

You are the Inventory Agent for a DAML (Canton) template audit. You inventory ALL breadth findings AND audit choice-consequence trace coverage in a single pass.
Execute the instructions below directly and stop. Do not spawn subagents.

> **Note**: Confidence scoring is computed by the `confidence` phase
> AFTER Phase 4b iteration 1, not during inventory. Your job is to
> inventory findings and prepare depth candidates.

> **DAML object model (the through-line)**: A "state variable" is a
> `(Template T, field f)` pair. A "writer" is a choice whose consequences
> `create`/`archive` a `T`. A "reader" is any choice / `ensure` / `controller`
> that `fetch` / `lookupByKey` / `exerciseByKey` a `T` and branches on `f`. The
> security unit is the transaction tree: required authorizers of every node
> must be a subset of submitter-supplied authorizers, and signatory authority
> propagates exactly ONE hop into a choice's consequences.

Read ALL files matching {SCRATCHPAD}/analysis_*.md
Before parsing, build and record an explicit source-file manifest:
- List every existing first-pass `analysis_*.md` file.
- Include `analysis_rescan_*.md` and `analysis_percontract_*.md` if they exist;
  they are discovery producer outputs consumed by inventory, not later phases.
- Exclude report, verification, chain, depth, and non-discovery artifacts even
  if their names are mentioned in prose.
- In `## Source Summary`, include one row per source file with the number of
  finding blocks parsed from that exact file.
- The merge receipt/source summary must account for every parsed source finding
  block. Do not return until parsed source blocks, source summary counts, and
  inventory finding blocks reconcile.

For each file:
- Extract all findings and DEPTH_TARGETS
- Extract Step Execution fields - flag findings with ✗ or ? without valid reasons
- Extract Rules Applied field - flag missing rule applications (R1-R16, D1-D10)

## TASK 1: Findings Inventory

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Findings Inventory
**Total: {N} findings from {M} agents**
| # | Finding ID | Agent | Severity | Location | Title | Verdict | Step Execution | Rules Applied | RAG Confidence |

## Chain Summary
| Finding ID | Location | Root Cause (1-line) | Verdict | Severity | Precondition Type | Postcondition Type |
|------------|----------|--------------------:|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|

## REFUTED Findings (for Depth Second Opinion)
| Finding ID | Agent | Reason for REFUTED | Missing Precondition | Domain |

## CONTESTED Findings (for Depth Priority)
| Finding ID | Agent | External Dep Involved | Worst-Case Severity | Notes |

## Incomplete Analysis Flags
| Finding ID | Missing Steps | Reason Invalid? | Flag for Depth? |

## Rule Application Violations
| Finding ID | Rule | Expected | Actual | Violation? |

Check these DAML-specific rules IN ADDITION to R1-R16:

- D1 (Authorizer Subset): For each `create`/`exercise`/`archive` node " verify the required authorizers (signatories of a created contract; controllers of an exercised choice; signatories of an archived contract) are a subset of the parties authorizing the transaction. A single controller where the operation should require joint authorization (single-where-joint) is a co-authorization gap " flag for state-trace depth (D1 High).
- D2 (Controller From Argument): If a choice's `controller` is derived from a choice **argument** or a mutable template field rather than a fixed signatory/observer party " this is privilege injection. Flag CRITICAL: an attacker can name themselves controller and exercise the choice. `[AUTH:ARG-DERIVED]`.
- D3 (Consuming Correctness): For each choice, verify its consume-mode is correct for its effect. A value-moving choice that is `nonconsuming` (or omits the consuming default by accident) can be exercised repeatedly on the same contract " double-exercise/double-spend. A `preconsuming`/`postconsuming` choice that `fetch`es its own contract after archival is a self-fetch-after-archive bug.
- D4 (Maintainer ⊆ Signatory): If a template declares a `key` " verify every maintainer party is also a signatory of the template. A maintainer that is not a signatory is a malformed key authority " flag for state-trace depth.
- D5 (lookupByKey False-None): If `lookupByKey`/`visibleByKey` is used and a `None` result drives a branch (e.g. "key not found → create fresh / skip check") " verify the code does not treat `None` as "the contract does not exist". `None` means "the submitting party cannot SEE a contract with that key" (visibility), not "no such contract exists". A false-None branch enables duplicate-create or guard-skip. Flag (D5).
- D6 (CID Binding): If a choice accepts a caller-supplied `ContractId` argument " verify the CID is bound to the operation (the fetched contract is validated to belong to / reference the exercising contract). An unbound caller-supplied CID lets an attacker pass a lookalike or attacker-owned contract " wrong-CID / type-confusion. Flag (D6).
- D7 (Fail-Open Config CID): If a choice reads a config/whitelist/registry `ContractId` to gate an action " verify behavior when that config is absent/None. A missing config that defaults to "allow" is fail-open. A hardcoded/stale config CID that can no longer be fetched (`CONTRACT_NOT_FOUND`) is a brick. Flag (D7).
- D8 (Ensure Gap): For each template, verify the `ensure` clause enforces every invariant the choices assume (non-negative amounts, value conservation, deadline ordering). A missing `ensure` predicate means an invalid contract is creatable directly. Arithmetic on DAML `Int`/`Decimal` THROWS on overflow " so an overflow is a reachable `abort`/brick (a LIVENESS bug), not a silent wrap. Flag (D8).
- D9 (Observer / Divulgence Scope): For each template, verify the `observer` set is not broader than the disclosure intent, and that no choice `fetch`es a contract in a shared transaction in a way that divulges it to an unintended party. Interface `view` exposure counts. Reportable ONLY with a party-scoped `query@T party` PoC steer. Flag (D9).
- D10 (Cancel/Abort Unwind): If a multi-step operation creates intermediate contracts (locks, escrows, proposals) " verify a cancel/abort/reject path archives ALL intermediate contracts and unwinds any locked/minted value. A cancel that leaves a child contract live or value locked is a no-unwind bug. Flag (D10).

`✗(N/A — removed by construction)` for generic rules with no DAML analog: R11 (Unsolicited Token Transfer), R15 (Flash Loan), R16 (Oracle Integrity).

## TASK 1.5: Assumption Dependency Cross-Reference

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/design_context.md - specifically the Trust Assumption Table (party trust levels: signatory/controller parties tiered FULLY_TRUSTED / SEMI_TRUSTED / UNTRUSTED).

For each finding in the Findings Inventory above, identify the **party/role required to exercise the attack choice** (the actor), then cross-reference against the Trust Assumption Table:

| Condition | Tag | Severity Effect |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Attack requires `FULLY_TRUSTED` party to act maliciously | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: TRUSTED-ACTOR]` | −1 tier (applied by Index Agent) |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` party (operator/admin) to act maliciously | No tag | No change - severity matrix Likelihood axis already captures 'specific conditions/complex setup' |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` party to act WITHIN stated bounds | `[ASSUMPTION-DEP: WITHIN-BOUNDS]` | Flag only - no severity change |
| Attack requires `SEMI_TRUSTED` party to EXCEED stated bounds | No tag | Real finding - no change |
| Attack requires `UNTRUSTED` party or exploits `PRECONDITION` (ensure/authorizer) violation | No tag | Real finding - no change |

**Rules**:
- `TRUSTED-ACTOR` tag is ONLY for `FULLY_TRUSTED` parties (e.g., governance multisig signatory, admin party with unrestricted upgrade/config authority). NEVER tag `SEMI_TRUSTED` parties as `TRUSTED-ACTOR` - their findings are calibrated through the severity matrix Likelihood axis instead.
- Only tag if the finding's ENTIRE attack path depends on the assumption. If the attack has BOTH a trusted-party path AND an untrusted-party path → no tag.
- `WITHIN-BOUNDS` means the attack's impact does not exceed what the stated bounds already allow. If the finding shows impact BEYOND stated bounds → no tag (real bug).
- When uncertain whether impact exceeds bounds → do NOT tag. Err on the side of preserving severity.
- **R10 anti-burden-inversion (external-assumption findings)**: When a finding's harm mechanism is CONFIRMED in-scope and ONLY an unresearched / out-of-scope EXTERNAL factor (counterparty honesty, an external decoder/consumer, off-chain behavior) could render it safe, do NOT demote it to Informational/Low. Keep it at its in-scope impact severity, tag it `[EXTERNAL-ASSUMPTION: <assumed safe condition>]`, and route to verification. Demotion requires POSITIVE in-scope evidence of the safe condition - its mere possibility does not rebut a mechanism already proven in-scope. This clause applies ONLY when (a) the harm mechanism is confirmed in-scope, AND (b) there is a concrete named consequence, AND (c) the required actor is NOT `FULLY_TRUSTED`. It is NOT a blanket "never demote": the legitimate `FULLY_TRUSTED` -1 tier above still applies to fully-trusted governance actors, and the semi-vs-fully-trusted table above is unchanged; this only blocks the burden-inversion demotion of a confirmed in-scope mechanism.

Append to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Assumption Dependency Audit
| Finding ID | Attack Actor (party/role) | Actor Trust Level | Within Bounds? | Tag | Original Severity |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----|-------------------|

## Static Analyzer Finding Promotion (NO-OP for DAML)

DAML has **no security static-analysis prepass** (DLint is style-only; there is
no SCIP/Scout/Slither indexer for DAML). There is no `static_analysis.md`
security-detector block to promote, and there is no `slither`/`opengrep`/`scout`
detector file. **Do NOT halt** on the absence of a promotion source.

The ONLY promotion source is the recon `daml test` run:

### Reachable-Abort Promotion (the ONLY DAML promotion path)

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/test_results.md (the `daml test` output captured by recon).

For each `daml test` result that surfaced a `PreconditionFailed` / `abort` /
`AssertionFailed` on a **user-reachable** path, promote a single hypothesis:

| Test Signal | Promoted Severity | Hypothesis ID | Hypothesis Title | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Reachable `PreconditionFailed`/`abort` on a non-negative-test path | **Low** | `[DML-DT-N]` | Reachable abort / liveness brick on user path | Promote ONLY if the failing path is NOT one of the suite's own `submitMustFail` negative-test cases |

**Filter (MANDATORY)**: `daml test` runs every in-scope `Script ()`. Many
`Script`s are deliberate negative tests built around `submitMustFail` — their
"failure" IS the assertion passing, not a bug. Before promoting any
reachable-abort signal, cross-check the failing path against the test suite's
own `submitMustFail` cases. If the abort is the expected outcome of a
`submitMustFail` case → **do NOT promote** (it is a passing negative test). Only
promote an UNEXPECTED reachable abort on a path a normal party would traverse.
If nothing qualifies → **no-op, do not halt**.

`[DML-DT-N]` promotions start at Low pending verification by depth agents (the
boundary/invariant lane re-evaluates whether the abort is a genuine liveness
brick at a higher severity per Rule 10).

---

## TASK 2: Choice-Consequence Trace Audit

DAML has no "external call" in the EVM sense. The analog is **one choice
exercising another template's choice (or `create`/`archive`/`fetch`-ing another
template) in its consequences** — and signatory/controller authority propagates
exactly ONE hop into those consequences. This trace audits that one-hop
authority boundary and the (Template, field) writes it produces.

Read {SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md (Choice-Consequence sections) and
{SCRATCHPAD}/call_graph.md (the choice-consequence graph: which choices
create/exercise/archive/fetch which templates).

For EACH choice whose consequences create/archive/exercise/fetch another
template, cross-reference against the breadth analysis files you already read:

### Choice-Consequence Trace Template

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Which choice has these consequences? | {Module.daml}:{Template.Choice}:{line} |
| 2 | What does it exercise/create/archive/fetch in its consequences? | {target Template.Choice or Template} |
| 3 | What (Template, field) does it create / archive? | {list (T,f) pairs created and archived} |
| 4 | Is the one-hop authority covered? (are the required authorizers of the consequence a subset of the parent's authority?) | YES (parent signatory/controller covers it) / NO (needs an authority the parent lacks → would fail, OR escalates authority the caller should not have) |
| 5 | Is any caller-supplied `ContractId` passed into the consequence UNBOUND? | YES (not validated to belong to the operation) / NO |
| 6 | Does the consequence take a `lookupByKey` `None` branch as "absent"? | YES (false-None risk) / NO |
| 7 | Does a pre/postconsuming choice `fetch` its own contract AFTER archival? | YES (self-fetch-after-archive) / NO |
| 8 | Does the consequence mint/lock value that is NOT un-unwound on a cancel/abort path? | YES (no-unwind) / NO |

### Trace Termination
Continue tracing until ONE of:
- One-hop authority is covered, CID bound, None handled, no self-fetch, value unwound → SAFE
- One-hop authority gap (required authorizer absent or escalated beyond caller intent) → **FINDING** (D1)
- Caller-supplied `ContractId` passed unbound into a consequence → **FINDING** (D6)
- Config/whitelist CID absent and defaults to allow → **FINDING** (D7)
- Minted/locked value not un-unwound on cancel/abort → **FINDING** (D10)

### Cross-Reference with Breadth
For each trace, check if breadth agents already identified a finding covering this path:
- If YES: note 'Covered by [XX-N]' and verify same termination point
- If NO: this is a NEW gap - create finding [DML-SE-N]

### Choice-Consequence Trace Output
Append to {SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md:

## Choice-Consequence Trace Audit
### Consequence Site Summary
| # | Choice (Template.Choice) | Exercises/Creates/Archives | (Template,field) Written | One-Hop Auth Covered? | Caller-CID Unbound? | lookupByKey None Branch? | Self-Fetch After Archive? | Un-unwound Mint/Lock? | Breadth Coverage | Finding |
|---|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|---------|

### Choice-Consequence Findings (if any)
Use finding IDs [DML-SE-1], [DML-SE-2], etc. with standard finding format.

### Choice-Consequence Coverage Gaps
List any consequence targets (cross-package `data-dependencies` templates, interface instances) that could not be fully analyzed without the target template's source.

## TASK 3: Elevated Signal Audit

Read `{SCRATCHPAD}/attack_surface.md` and extract all `[ELEVATE]` tags
(`[ELEVATE:PARAM_CONTROLLER]`, `[ELEVATE:MISSING_COAUTH]`,
`[ELEVATE:NONCONSUMING_REPLAY]`, `[ELEVATE:VALUE_CONSERVATION]`,
`[ELEVATE:LOCK_BYPASS]`, `[ELEVATE:CID_BINDING]`, `[ELEVATE:FAIL_OPEN]`,
`[ELEVATE:CID_BRICK]`, `[ELEVATE:LOOKUP_FALSE_NONE]`, `[ELEVATE:DIVULGENCE]`,
`[ELEVATE:OBSERVER_BROAD]`, `[ELEVATE:ENSURE_GAP]`,
`[ELEVATE:DEADLINE_UNENFORCED]`).

For each `[ELEVATE]` tag:

| # | Signal | Tag Type | Addressed by Finding? | Finding ID | If Not Addressed |
|---|--------|----------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | {signal text} | {tag type} | YES/NO | {ID or NONE} | Flag for depth |

**Rules**:
- Every `[ELEVATE]` tag MUST be explicitly addressed - either covered by an existing finding or flagged for depth review
- If NO finding addresses the signal → add to `depth_candidates.md` as HIGH priority investigation target
- "Addressed" means a finding explicitly analyzed the risk described by the signal, not just mentioned the same code location

Append to `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md`:

## Elevated Signal Audit
| Signal | Tag | Addressed? | Finding ID / Depth Flag |

---

## TASK 4: Depth Candidates

Write to {SCRATCHPAD}/depth_candidates.md:
## Depth Candidates
Categorize ALL findings by depth domain (DAML reframing of the four canonical lanes):
- Asset Semantics (Token Flow lane): consume-mode misuse → double-exercise/double-spend, value-conservation + rounding across split/merge/transfer, accumulator/cap across txns, lock-invariant (lock-bypass / lock-erase), cancel-no-unwind, metadata overwrite
- State/Key Lifecycle (State Trace lane): choice-level AUTHORIZATION (missing co-auth, arg-derived controller, missing owner==party, guard bypass, fetch-based auth, over-broad delegation), `lookupByKey` false-None, `exerciseByKey`/maintainer-authority gaps (maintainer ⊆ signatory), stale state, missing cleanup
- Boundary/Invariant (Edge Case lane): `ensure`-clause gaps (invalid contract creatable), arithmetic abort/brick (Int/Decimal throw → liveness), deadline-not-enforced, value rounding boundaries
- Capability / Privacy / Interface (External lane): caller-supplied `ContractId` binding / fail-open / stale-CID brick / wrong-CID type confusion, unverified `fromInterfaceContractId` coercion, interface-choice wrong-controller, interface `view` over-exposure, over-broad `observer` / divulgence-via-fetch (privacy reportable ONLY with a party-scoped `query@T party` steer)

## Second Opinion Targets
List ALL REFUTED findings that depth agents MUST re-evaluate:
| Finding ID | Domain | Breadth Reasoning | Potential Enablers |

## TASK 4.5: Quick Chain Pre-Scan (Dependency-Aware Severity)

For each finding with Severity=Low AND a non-empty Postcondition Type in the Chain Summary:

1. Search ALL findings with Severity >= Medium that have a Missing Precondition matching this Low finding's Postcondition Type
2. If MATCH FOUND (same type AND compatible description):
   - Tag the Low finding as `CHAIN_ESCALATED: enables {Medium+ finding ID}`
   - Set `effective_severity = Medium` (for depth budget allocation ONLY - reported severity unchanged)
3. Write escalated findings to depth_candidates.md under '## Chain-Escalated Findings'

| Low Finding | Postcondition | Matching Medium+ Finding | Missing Precondition | Escalation |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------|

**HARD RULE**: This does NOT change the finding's actual severity. It only affects depth budget priority. The chain analysis agent (Phase 4c) determines final severity.

**Cap**: Maximum 5 escalations per audit. If more than 5 match, prioritize by the highest severity of the matching Medium+ finding.

## TASK 5: State Dependency Cross-Reference (the DAML variable-finding map)

Using `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_variables.md` (`Template.field : Type`),
`{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md` (choices), and `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_write_map.md`
(choice → (Template,field) created/archived), build a cross-choice dependency
map keyed on `(Template T, field f)`.

For each `(Template T, field f)` written (created/archived with a new value) by
choice A and read/branched-on (via `fetch`/`lookupByKey`/`exerciseByKey`/
`ensure`/`controller`) by choice or clause B — where A ≠ B and A is externally
exercisable:
- Can A reach a value of `(T, f)` that breaks B's assumption?
- Also check: can a `lookupByKey (T, f)` in B return `None` ("not visible")
  where B treats it as "absent" (Key-None risk)?

Write to `{SCRATCHPAD}/state_dependency_map.md`:

| (Template, field) | Type | Writer Choice | Consumer Choice / Clause | Can Writer Break Consumer? | Key-None Risk? |
|-------------------|------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|

**Rules**:
- Cap at 30 rows. Prioritize: externally exercisable writers first, critical consumers (transfer, claim, settle, unlock, archive, exercise-gated-by-`(T,f)`) first
- Omit trivially safe pairs (both share the same controller/signatory constraint AND the writer cannot set an invalid value)
- The "Can Writer Break Consumer?" column is YES/NO with a 1-phrase reason. YES entries become depth agent investigation targets
- Key-None Risk column: YES if B uses `lookupByKey`/`visibleByKey` on `(T,f)` and a `None` result drives an "absent" branch. Flag for D5 depth review.
- Filter: different choices only (self-reads within the same choice are not cross-choice conflicts)

> **Chain handoff**: `state_dependency_map.md` IS the DAML variable-finding map
> the Phase 4c chain analyzer matches postconditions/preconditions on. State-type
> preconditions are keyed on the `(Template, field)` name (the direct analog of
> the EVM/Soroban variable-name match).

---

## Choice-Consumption Classification in Findings

For each finding that involves a choice, tag the choice's consume-mode in the finding's Location field:

| Consume Mode | Tag | Replay/Ordering Risk |
|--------------|-----|---------------------|
| `consuming` (default) | `[CHOICE:CONSUMING]` | Archives the contract on first exercise; a 2nd `exerciseCmd` MUST fail `CONTRACT_NOT_FOUND` |
| `nonconsuming` | `[CHOICE:NONCONSUMING]` | Contract survives; choice is replayable — a value-mover here can double-spend |
| `preconsuming`/`postconsuming` | `[CHOICE:PRE-POSTCONSUMING]` | Archival ordering relative to consequences matters; self-`fetch` after archive aborts |

A finding tagged `[CHOICE:NONCONSUMING]` on a value-moving or single-use choice should be flagged for D3 (consuming-correctness) depth analysis.
A finding tagged `[CHOICE:PRE-POSTCONSUMING]` that self-`fetch`es after archival should be escalated for state-trace depth.

---

## Controller / Signatory Coverage Tagging

For each choice listed in `{SCRATCHPAD}/function_list.md` and
`{SCRATCHPAD}/choice_summary.md`, tag its authorization coverage:

| Auth Tag | Meaning | Depth Priority |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `[AUTH:JOINT-OK]` | Controllers are the correct fixed signatory parties; joint authorization where required | Low |
| `[AUTH:SINGLE]` | A single controller where the operation should require joint authorization (single-where-joint) | High - flag for D1 state-trace depth |
| `[AUTH:ARG-DERIVED]` | Controller derived from a choice argument or mutable field (privilege injection) | Critical - immediate flag (D2) |
| `[AUTH:FETCH-BASED]` | Authorization decision made on a forgeable `fetch`ed contract rather than signatory authority | High - flag for state-trace depth |
| `[AUTH:CONDITIONAL]` | Auth/guard check present only in some branches of the choice body | High - flag for state-trace depth |

Append to `{SCRATCHPAD}/findings_inventory.md`:

## Controller/Signatory Coverage
| Choice (Template.Choice) | Module.daml:Line | Consume Mode | Auth Tag | Depth Priority | Notes |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------|----------|---------------|-------|
