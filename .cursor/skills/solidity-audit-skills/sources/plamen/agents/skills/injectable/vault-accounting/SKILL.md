## Orchestrator Decomposition Guide
When decomposing this skill into depth agent investigation questions, map sections to domains:
- Sections 1, 4: depth-edge-case (share price boundaries, first depositor)
- Sections 2, 2b: depth-state-trace (time-decay state consistency, anchor timestamps)
- Section 2c: depth-edge-case OR depth-state-trace (reported-vs-held asset divergence at dust supply)
- Sections 3, 5, 5b: depth-token-flow (fee flows, cross-fee ratios, fee solvency)
- Section 6: depth-edge-case OR depth-state-trace (withdrawal fairness)

## When This Skill Activates

Recon classifies protocol as `vault` type based on indicators: deposit/withdraw/shares/strategy/vault.
This skill adds vault-specific accounting checks that the general ECONOMIC_DESIGN_AUDIT does not cover.

## 1. Share Price Consistency Under Adversity

For vault protocols with share-based accounting (LP tokens, vault shares):

Compute share price = total_assets / total_shares at these states:
| State | total_assets | total_shares | Share Price | Expected | Issue? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| After deposit | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |
| After withdrawal | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |
| After profit report | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |
| After loss report | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |
| After fee harvest | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |
| After time-decay expiry | {val} | {val} | {computed} | {expected} | |

Tag: `[TRACE:state={event} -> share_price={value} -> {expected_or_unexpected}]`

## 2. Time-Decay State Consistency (if applicable)

For vaults with time-decay mechanisms (locked profit, vesting schedules, streaming distributions):
- Identify the BASE variable the decay operates on and the DECAY variable that diminishes over time
- Enumerate ALL state transitions that modify the BASE (profit, loss, deposit, withdrawal, fee harvest)
- For EACH transition: does the DECAY variable adjust accordingly? If BASE decreases but DECAY doesn't → DECAY can exceed BASE
- Does adding new value to the decay (e.g., reporting new profit) reset the timer for ALL remaining decay, or only for the new portion?
- At decay duration = 0: does everything release immediately? At MAX duration?
- After full decay completion: is the decay variable exactly 0, or can dust remain?

Tag: `[TRACE:{transition} -> {base_var} changed -> {decay_var} unchanged -> {decay_var} > {base_var} -> {consumer} computes {wrong_result}]`

### 2b. Time-Weighted Anchor Timestamp Validation

For time-weighted calculations (fees, vesting, rewards) that use a `(value × timeDelta)` formula:
1. Identify the ANCHOR timestamp (e.g., `lastDistributionTime` (vesting vaults), `periodFinish`/`lastUpdateTime` (Synthetix-style staking), `lastFeeCollection` (management fee), `lastStreamUpdate` (streaming))
2. Trace ALL functions that START a new time-weighted period (e.g., `distributeYield`/`updateSharePrice` (vesting vaults), `notifyRewardAmount` (Synthetix), `reportProfit`/`report` (Yearn-style), `startNewEpoch` (epoch-based))
3. For each: does it update the anchor timestamp to `block.timestamp` (or `now`) UNCONDITIONALLY, or only inside a conditional block?
4. If the anchor is NOT updated when a new period starts: `timeDelta` in the next calculation will include time from BEFORE the new period, causing accelerated vesting/fee accrual
5. Test: what happens if the anchor timestamp is 7 days stale when a new period of 7 days starts? fraction = 7d/(7d+7d) = 50% vests immediately instead of 0%

Tag: `[TRACE:new_period_start → anchor_timestamp NOT updated → timeDelta includes {stale_duration} → {acceleration_factor}x acceleration]`

### 2c. Reported-vs-Held Asset Divergence at Dust Supply

For any accounting getter intentionally OVERRIDDEN to diverge from the real held balance (excluding an unvested/streaming/pending component):

1. Determine whether its output can INCREASE purely from elapsed time (vesting) with no deposit/withdraw/donation event.
2. If yes, at every window where `totalSupply` is zero or dust while that divergence is closing, compute `shares = deposit * totalSupply / reportedAssets()` with real constants for a minimal deposit — does round-down zero/critically dilute the depositor because reported-assets rose ahead of supply?
3. Treat as a first-depositor/inflation-family finding whose value-injection trigger is the protocol's OWN accounting formula (time-based vesting), not an external donation — check the HARM in the depositor-LOSES direction, not only the attacker-profits direction of ZERO_STATE_RETURN §2a.

Tag: `[TRACE:reportedAssets() rises via vesting_elapsed → totalSupply=dust → shares=deposit*totalSupply/reportedAssets() rounds down → depositor loses principal]`

## 3. Cross-Fee Ratio Dependency (if applicable)

For vaults where one fee type changes a ratio that another fee type reads:
- For each fee type, trace whether applying it changes the canonical assets/shares ratio
- Map fee→ratio→fee chains: if fee A changes the ratio and fee B uses that ratio as input, compute the combined effective rate
- For ratio-threshold mechanisms (e.g., high water marks, performance benchmarks): does any fee or state change shift the ratio without representing actual protocol performance?
- For ratio snapshots: after a negative event (loss, slashing), does the snapshot become permanently stale? Is there a reset or recalibration path?

## 4. First Depositor / Dead Weight / Re-entry

- Is there first-depositor protection (minimum deposit, virtual shares, burned initial shares)?
- After all users exit (return to zero): does the protection re-activate?
- Can residual dust/fees create an exploitable state for the next depositor?

## 5. Fee Source Analysis

For each fee accumulator (platform fees, performance fees, management fees, yield fees):
1. Trace the fee claim path: does `claimFees()` transfer vault assets out, or mint new tokens to the fee recipient?
2. If vault assets are transferred out: are corresponding shares burned to maintain the assets-per-share ratio? If NO → fees dilute existing shareholders (share-backed liability). Flag as finding.
3. If new shares are minted to the fee recipient: does the mint inflate total supply without adding assets? If YES → same dilution effect. Flag as finding.
4. Assess whether the dilution is documented/intended (management fee model) vs undocumented/surprising to depositors.

### 5b. Fee Solvency Under Stress

For each fee accumulator identified in section 5:
1. Trace total accrued fees (feeAccumulator or equivalent) across a sequence: deposit → yield → loss → yield → fee claim
2. Verify: can accrued fees exceed the vault's actual available assets? If fees are computed on a snapshot (e.g., `lastRecordedSupply × sharePrice × timeDelta`) and the snapshot is NOT reduced by loss events, fees accumulate on phantom assets
3. Check: does the fee calculation use `min(currentSupply, lastUpdateSupply)` or equivalent conservative bounding? If YES, verify the `lastUpdateSupply` is updated on ALL paths (deposit, withdrawal, loss, yield)
4. If fees can exceed vault solvency → FINDING: fee solvency gap under stress
5. **Fee base amplification**: Trace whether the fee calculation base (e.g., `totalAssets`, `sharePrice`, `exchangeRate`) can be INFLATED by a preceding operation in the same transaction or administrative sequence. Pattern: admin resets a high-water mark or benchmark → fee base recalculates from a lower reference → next yield event charges fees on phantom gains that were previously below the benchmark. Check: does the fee base track CUMULATIVE gain or INCREMENTAL gain since last collection? If cumulative: can any reset/recalibration cause double-counting?

### 5c. Fee Extraction vs Exchange Rate Consistency

For each fee claim path identified in section 5:
1. Are accrued fees subtracted from the exchange rate / share price BEFORE the fee claim transfers assets out? If fees inflate the exchange rate but are then extracted without deflating it → last redeemer insolvency
2. If vault assets are deployed externally (strategies, lending, bridges): does the fee claim path verify sufficient liquid reserves? If fees are claimable against the full balance but assets are illiquid → fee claim can drain liquid reserves below withdrawal needs

Tag: `[TRACE:loss_event → fee_base_unchanged → feesOwed > available_assets → {impact}]`

## 6. Withdrawal Fairness Under Stress

- If withdrawal is multi-step (request -> wait -> execute): can vault conditions change between steps?
- Are withdrawal amounts computed at request time or execution time?
- Can a large withdrawal request starve subsequent requestors?
