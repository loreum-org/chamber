## Driver

One-liner: **Python driver → worker pool → one backend PTY session (Claude Code or Codex) per artifact → disk artifact gate → retry only missing/bad rows. The worker saying "done" is not trusted; disk markers are.**

The pipeline driver (`plamen_driver.py`) executes phases as isolated subprocesses. This is the only execution model — all invocations (`/plamen-wizard`, `plamen` terminal, `plamen core`, etc.) launch this driver. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux against either the Claude Code or Codex (BETA) backend.

### Driver layout

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `plamen_driver.py` | Phase scheduling, checkpointing, retry, gate checking, worker-pool orchestration |
| `plamen_types.py` | Canonical definitions (evidence tags, severities, finding ID regex); `plamen_home()` resolves `~/.plamen/` (canonical install root) — `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/plamen/` are install-created symlinks pointing at it, see `glossary.md` / `repository-structure.md` |
| `plamen_parsers.py` | LLM output parsing (report index, verification results) |
| `plamen_validators.py` | Artifact quality gates (mechanical, not LLM-dependent); per-row marker statuses (`_BREADTH_STATUS_*`, `scripts/plamen_validators.py:931-935`) |
| `plamen_prompt.py` | Phase prompt building with forward-ref sanitization |
| `plamen_mechanical.py` | Deterministic report assembly, dedup, tier dispatch |
| `plamen_display.py` | Rich terminal UI for driver progress |
| `plamen_markdown.py` | Markdown AST helpers shared between parsers and validators |
| `plamen_contracts.py` | Worker artifact / marker envelope contracts (manifest schema, expected-output shape) |
| `mechanical_verify.py` | Phase 5 mechanical verification helpers (severity caps, PoC demotions, integrity gates) |
| `chain_prep.py` | Chain-analysis pre-pass: extracts candidate finding pairs with shared state / type before the chain LLM phase |
| `report_index_machinery.py` | Report-index ID assignment and `report_coverage.md` ledger reconciliation |
| `pty_exec.py` | Claude PTY session: POSIX `pty.openpty()` + `Popen` with `preexec_fn` setup, Windows `winpty.PtyProcess.spawn`; `ClaudePtySession`, transcript polling, compaction detection (`scripts/pty_exec.py:858-1245`) |
| `preflight_pty_transports.py` | Per-host PTY transport probe; cache schema v3 (`scripts/preflight_pty_transports.py:62`) |
| `codex_adapter.py` | Codex CLI backend: tool translation, path rewriting (`~/.claude/` ↔ `~/.codex/plamen/`) |
| `recon_prepass.py` | Pre-recon static analysis (Slither, Opengrep, SCIP) |

The driver auto-detects the active backend via `plamen_home()` (`scripts/plamen_types.py:87-101`). Resolution order: `PLAMEN_HOME` env → script-relative install root → `~/.claude/` fallback. The canonical install lives under `~/.plamen/`; the backend-named directories (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/plamen/`) are symlinks created at install time so each CLI can find the same prompts/rules/skills tree. Config files differ per backend: `CLAUDE.md` + `settings.json` + `mcp.json` for Claude Code; `AGENTS.md` + `config.toml` for Codex.

### Execution model

Three execution shapes coexist behind the same `plamen_home()` and disk-gate primitives:

1. **Direct PTY worker pool** — used for `breadth`, `rescan`, `per_contract`, and `depth`. The driver builds a manifest of expected output artifacts (one per spawned worker), launches a bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`_run_breadth_worker_pool_pty`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:7696-7866`), and spawns one Claude PTY session per row via `ClaudePtySession`. Each worker's success is a disk artifact passing the row gate — the worker's prose `DONE` is **advisory only**.
2. **LLM phase session** — used for sequential analytical phases (recon, inventory, chain, report_index, skeptic, judge, crossbatch, tier writers, etc.). The driver spawns one Claude PTY session per phase, supervises it with `wait_for_turn_complete`, and runs `gate_passes` against the scratchpad after the turn ends.
3. **Python mechanical** — used for `inventory_prepare`, `report_assemble`, `chain_prep`, `verify_aggregate`, semantic-dedup fallback, severity binding, and similar plumbing phases. No LLM is spawned; deterministic Python in `plamen_mechanical.py` / `mechanical_verify.py` / `chain_prep.py` / `report_index_machinery.py` reads and writes scratchpad artifacts in-process.

All three shapes share the same checkpoint (`_v2_checkpoint.json`), the same `gate_passes` validator, the same `plamen_home()`-derived paths, and the same artifact ownership rules. Phase ordering and retry policy live in `plamen_driver.py`; shape-specific behavior is dispatched by phase name.

### Model routing

Opus phases run on **Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`) by default across all modes — its stronger multi-step instruction-following reduces attempt-1 misses on recon coverage, breadth/rescan fan-out, and verification rigor (`PLAMEN_OPUS_MODEL`, `scripts/plamen_types.py:105-125`). **Core** (like all modes) defaults its opus tier to Opus 4.8; the **Thorough** promotion only additionally raises to Opus 4.8 the reasoning-critical roles (discovery = breadth + depth, verification shards, skeptic-judge) that would otherwise run on Sonnet, while **Light** stays on Sonnet to bound plan usage (`PLAMEN_THOROUGH_OPUS_MODEL`, `scripts/plamen_types.py:111-118`). Both defaults are env-overridable for benchmarking or cost-capping.

### Backends (Claude Code + Codex BETA)

The driver runs against two interchangeable CLI backends behind the same `plamen_home()` and disk-gate primitives:

- **Claude Code** (default) — config files `CLAUDE.md` + `settings.json` + `mcp.json`.
- **Codex CLI** (`codex exec`, **BETA / cost-saving**) — OpenAI's CLI as an alternative worker backend, with research-backed model/tier/compact configuration and per-job depth fan-out (one `codex exec` per depth job, which fixes the never-cut-stub halt). Codex model aliases map through `_CODEX_MODEL_MAP` (`scripts/plamen_types.py:128`), config files are `AGENTS.md` + `config.toml`, and `codex_adapter.py` regenerates them from the Claude-side manifests to prevent drift. Codex usage-cap messages are detected in natural language so the driver auto-waits instead of halting, Codex depth runs real Devil's-Advocate iter-2, and `context-exceeded` no longer perma-fails. The active backend is detected at startup (`backend == "codex"`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:211`) and selected paths/tools are translated only when Codex is active.

### Cross-platform (Windows + macOS + Linux)

The PTY worker-pool model runs on all three platforms. POSIX hosts (macOS, Linux) use `pty.openpty()` + `Popen` ownership with a `SIGCHLD` reset on spawn; Windows uses `winpty` (see the PTY transport section below). Nested-session env isolation strips `CLAUDE_CODE_*` markers from child workers on every platform, and PATH is persisted into the child environment so backend binaries resolve.

### Ecosystem auto-detection

The configured language/ecosystem is mechanically auto-detected and auto-corrected at startup with no halt-to-rerun (`_detect_ecosystem`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:16280`), shown on the startup banner, and resolved via manifest-priority rules (a suffix-only signal never clobbers an explicit config; native-SDK / Pinocchio Solana is detected at high confidence). The auto-corrector is recall-safe by design — a wrong auto-correct is treated as worse than the status quo (`_language_correction`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:16238`), and L1 pipelines always keep their configured Rust/Go language.

### Haltless resilience

A finished audit is never discarded at the finish line. The `report_index`, `verify`, `inventory`, and resume paths **repair-then-degrade** instead of halting: unfinished obligations are surfaced as flagged Appendix-B items in `AUDIT_REPORT.md` rather than blocking the run. Retry/recovery is unified across backend × mode × pipeline (hinted 3rd retry for under-covering phases, rescan added to recovering phases, verify queue-completeness backfill that stops the resume-rewind loop), and stale/corrupt checkpoints recover rather than stranding the run. Degraded phases carry a sentinel that is cleared on a genuine resume (`checkpoint.degraded` / `clear_degraded_sentinel`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:2187-2191`).

### Compaction as informational

When a Claude PTY session's transcript shows an auto-compaction event, the driver emits a one-shot `INFO` log line for the affected phase (`compaction_warned` guard, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:5658-5757`). Compaction never gates a phase and never alters control flow — the disk-gate verdict is the only authority. A coordinator that emits `DONE` after compaction but leaves the disk gate red is treated identically to any other premature-DONE: the missing-only / live / resume continuation handles recovery.

## Mechanical Derivers

> Deterministic Python functions — no LLM call — that generate, gate, promote, or reconcile findings directly against scratchpad artifacts and the mechanical reference graph. None of them assert a body-severity finding directly: every emitted candidate is a low-confidence `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` block that still passes through the normal chain/verify/report pipeline and the material-harm body floor. Source files: `scripts/enumeration_gate.py`, `scripts/plamen_mechanical.py`, `scripts/mechanical_verify.py`, `scripts/recon_prepass.py`, `scripts/plamen_contracts.py`, `scripts/plamen_markdown.py`.

### Source-ID candidate tags

The recall-generator functions below stamp a literal token into a candidate's `**Source IDs**:` line in `findings_inventory.md` (or, for two tags, into an internal receipt key only — never the markdown line itself). This table is the single place that tag is defined; see [glossary.md § Mechanical recall gates](glossary.md#mechanical-recall-gates-mechanisms--axes) for the plain-language description of the G1/G2/Gate V/Gate P/Mechanism-1/Mechanism-2 mechanisms these tags belong to.

| Tag | Meaning | Emitted by (function) | Code-parsed? |
|-----|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| `ENUMGAP` | G1/G2 co-reference coverage-gap candidate; also the default stamp actually written for the critical-asset-mover, array-uniqueness, and unbounded-input derivers below (they share the same emitter and never override the tag) | `validate_enumeration_coverage` (`enumeration_gate.py:282`) via the shared emitter `_emit_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:572`) | **Yes** |
| `ASSETMOVE` | Receipt/dedup key prefix only for the critical-asset-mover deriver — never written to a finding's `Source IDs` line (that line reads `ENUMGAP`, above) | `compute_critical_asset_mover_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:664`) | No |
| `ARRUNIQ` | Receipt/dedup key prefix only for the array-uniqueness deriver — same `ENUMGAP` caveat as `ASSETMOVE` | `compute_array_uniqueness_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:768`) | No |
| `UNBOUND` | Receipt/dedup key prefix only for the unbounded-input deriver — same `ENUMGAP` caveat | `compute_unbounded_input_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:835`) | No |
| `VARGAP-B` | Receipt-key prefix only for Gate V axis 2 (boundary-input coverage) — the text actually stamped into `Source IDs` is the plain `VARGAP` row below | `compute_boundary_input_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:994`) | No |
| `VARGAP-S` | Receipt-key prefix only for Gate V axis 3 (symmetric-operation coverage) — same `VARGAP` caveat | `compute_symmetric_operation_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:1100`) | No |
| `VARGAP` | The literal tag both Gate V axis derivers above actually stamp into a finding's `Source IDs` line | `compute_variant_gaps` (`enumeration_gate.py:1177`) | No — referenced only in a driver log line, not regex-matched |
| `PROMOGAP` | Gate P promotion-completeness candidate: harvested finding-shaped content routed to body/Appendix C/Appendix A as a fresh `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` block | `route_promotion_orphans` (`plamen_mechanical.py:5052`) | **Yes** |
| `INVARIANT:CI-n` | Mechanism 1 committed-invariant assertion candidate — always suffixed with the specific `CI-n` id, never bare `INVARIANT` | `compute_invariant_assertion_candidates` (`enumeration_gate.py:1266`) | **Yes** |
| `AXISGAP:<worker-finding-id>` | Mechanism 2 axis-coverage-gap candidate — always suffixed with the axis worker's own finding id | `compute_axis_coverage_gaps` / `promote_axis_findings_to_inventory` (`enumeration_gate.py:1772` / `:1907`) | **Yes** |
| `NEXP-n` | Raw finding-ID prefix from the Phase 4b.7 depth-exploration worker, promoted verbatim as the `Source IDs` value; matched by the same chain-enabler regex as `ENUMGAP` | `promote_enumgap_exploration_to_inventory` (`enumeration_gate.py:2068`) | **Yes** |

Every tag marked **Yes** above is matched by a downstream parser or gate (chain-enabler detection, the mechanism-attribution ledger, or the receipt/promotion machinery itself), so these literal strings are an internal contract — do not rename any of them without a coordinated code-and-test change (this file is documentation only).

### Recall-generators

Read the mechanical reference graph (bake output, below) plus the finding inventory and emit low-confidence candidates for gaps a purely LLM-driven pass tends to miss: unexamined co-referencing functions, unaddressed boundary values, unpaired symmetric operations, un-asserted local invariants, and (via the axis-coverage meta-pass) risk-axes never examined against the codebase's mechanically-ranked hot functions.

| Function | Location | Consumes | Produces | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| `compute_enumeration_obligations` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:191` | `_mechanical_graph.json`, `findings_inventory.md` | `enumeration_obligations.md`, `_enumeration_obligations.json` | G1: for each inventory finding, derives the co-referencing functions of the state symbols its enclosing function touches, from the unified reference graph |
| `compute_coverage_gaps` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:257` | `_enumeration_obligations.json`, `findings_inventory.md` | in-memory gap list (feeds `validate_enumeration_coverage`) | Pure diff half of G2: required co-referencers not mentioned anywhere in a finding's own block prose |
| `validate_enumeration_coverage` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:282` | `compute_coverage_gaps()` output, `findings_inventory.md`, `enumeration_gap_receipt.md` | `findings_inventory.md` (appended `ENUMGAP` blocks), `enumeration_gap_receipt.md` | G2: appends each unaddressed co-reference gap as a low-confidence `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` candidate, idempotent via a receipt |
| `_emit_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:572` | candidate list, `findings_inventory.md`, `enumeration_gap_receipt.md` | `findings_inventory.md` (appended blocks), `enumeration_gap_receipt.md` | Shared bounded, idempotent, append-only emitter substrate that every downstream obligation-deriver uses to turn candidate dicts into `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` inventory blocks |
| `compute_critical_asset_mover_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:664` | `_mechanical_graph.json`, production source tree | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`ASSETMOVE`) | Detects a same-file generic asset-mover function that can move a protocol-critical singleton state handle without excluding it, stranding dependent functions |
| `compute_array_uniqueness_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:768` | production source tree (per-language regex specs) | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`ARRUNIQ`) | Detects a function that loops a caller-supplied array with a per-element value effect and no uniqueness guard, so duplicate elements multiply the effect |
| `compute_unbounded_input_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:835` | production source tree | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`UNBOUND`) | Detects a caller-controlled string/bytes value stored on-chain with no length bound (storage-bloat / gas-bomb DoS) |
| `compute_boundary_input_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:994` | `_mechanical_graph.json`, `findings_inventory.md`, production source tree | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`VARGAP-B`) | Gate V axis 2: for each CONFIRMED/PARTIAL finding, checks whether its own prose addressed the required boundary set `{0,1,min,MAX,empty,self}` for the enclosing function's parameters |
| `compute_symmetric_operation_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:1100` | `chain_candidate_pairs.md`, `findings_inventory.md` | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`VARGAP-S`) | Gate V axis 3: reads structurally-paired operation legs (shared state/type signal) and flags when one leg is CONFIRMED/PARTIAL but its sibling leg's own finding is not |
| `compute_variant_gaps` / `validate_variant_coverage` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:1177` | outputs of the 3 axis derivers above | aggregate emitted-count dict | Gate V (Fix A) driver: runs the co-reference, boundary-input, and symmetric-operation axes together, unconditional and not confidence-gated |
| `compute_invariant_assertion_candidates` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:1266` | `exploration_skeptic_findings.md`, `skeptic_findings.md`, `depth_*_findings.md`, `verify_*.md`, `_mechanical_graph.json` | candidates via `_emit_candidates` (`INVARIANT`) | Mechanism 1: harvests committed-invariant blocks that skeptic/depth/verify phases stamp behind a SAFE/REFUTED verdict, turning each tacit local guard into a falsifiable low-confidence candidate |
| `compute_hot_function_set` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:1550` | `_mechanical_graph.json`, `function_summary.md`, `attack_surface.md`, production source tree | ranked, capped in-memory hot-function list (feeds `compute_axis_coverage_gaps`) | Mechanism 2: deterministically ranks the mechanically-hot production functions (log-dampened fan-in + state-write + elevate + value-effect + entry-point signals) so the LLM cannot clobber the target set |
| `compute_axis_coverage_gaps` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:1772` | `compute_hot_function_set()` output, `findings_inventory.md`, `depth_*_findings.md`, `*_findings.md` | `hot_function_axes.md`, `_hot_function_axes.json`, gap list | Mechanism 2 (axis-coverage meta-pass): builds a function x risk-axis (theft/liveness/accounting/provenance/boundary/identity) completeness matrix over the hot set, reading axis-EXAMINED only from the closed depth-evidence tag vocabulary; ambiguous defaults to GAP |
| `run_enumeration_gate` | `scripts/enumeration_gate.py:2181` | all deriver inputs above | aggregate obligations/gaps/emitted counts | Driver entry point: runs G1+G2 then every additional obligation-deriver, each with its own independent per-run emission budget so one deriver cannot starve another |

### Gates

Adjudicate mechanical claims against ground truth (the coverage seed, or actual test execution) rather than generating new candidates.

| Function | Location | Consumes | Produces | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| `compute_promotion_orphans` | `scripts/plamen_mechanical.py:4834` | `report_index_coverage_seed.md`, feeder globs (`depth_*.md`, `blind_spot_*.md`, `analysis_*.md`, checklists) | `promotion_orphans.md` | Gate P harvest: scans feeder artifacts for content-shaped finding blocks (real file:line location + mechanism cue + descriptive text) and reconciles each against the coverage seed; anything not already tracked is an orphan |
| `_promo_disposition` | `scripts/plamen_mechanical.py:4763` | one harvested candidate dict | `(disposition, reason)` tuple | Routes one harvested promotion-orphan candidate to BODY/APPENDIX_C/APPENDIX_A via the same material-harm classifier the disposition ledger uses |
| `route_promotion_orphans` | `scripts/plamen_mechanical.py:5052` | `compute_promotion_orphans()` output, `promotion_gate_receipt.md` | `findings_inventory.md` (appended `PROMOGAP` blocks), `promotion_routing.md`, `promotion_orphans_appendix_c.md`, `promotion_orphans_appendix_a.md`, `promotion_gate_receipt.md` | Gate P router: dispositions each harvested orphan to BODY (appended as a `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` candidate), Appendix C (quality/hardening), or Appendix A (refuted/content-less), idempotent via a content-hash receipt |
| `_classify_integrity` | `scripts/mechanical_verify.py:1546` | verifier prose evidence-tag claim, mechanical execution status, `verify_<ID>.md` text | `(integrity_state, effective_tag)` tuple | Integrity gate: compares a verifier's prose evidence-tag claim against the actual mechanical test-execution status; classifies CONSISTENT / INFLATED_PROSE / POC_UNVERIFIED_HARNESS / MECHANICAL_UNAVAILABLE and computes an effective tag |
| `flip_verdict_on_integrity_downgrade` | `scripts/mechanical_verify.py:1628` | `verify_<ID>.md` text | rewritten `verify_<ID>.md` Verdict field | Rewrites a verifier's Verdict field from CONFIRMED to CONTESTED `[INTEGRITY-DOWNGRADE]` when the integrity gate found inflated prose, so a mechanically-disproven exploit can never ship as verified-Critical |
| `_write_verdict_manifest` | `scripts/mechanical_verify.py:1648` | `ExecResult` list, `verify_<ID>.md` files | `verdict_manifest.json` | Writes the canonical per-finding effective evidence tag (post integrity-gate) that skeptic-judge and report-index phases read instead of the verifier's raw prose claim |
| `run_phase5b_mechanical_verify` | `scripts/mechanical_verify.py:1844` | `verify_<ID>.md` files, project build tree, language registry | `mechanical_verify_manifest.md`, `verdict_manifest.json`, annotated `verify_<ID>.md` files | Top-level driver entry: locates the build root, prewarms the build, runs each finding's PoC test mechanically, classifies pass/fail/harness-status, and writes the verdict manifest |

### Promotion

Move a worker- or exploration-phase finding into the inventory so it reaches chain analysis and verification instead of dead-ending in an intermediate artifact.

### Bake

Build the per-ecosystem mechanical reference graph that every recall-generator above reads. Tiered: a precise indexer (Slither / rust-analyzer SCIP / scip-go) when the toolchain is present and the project builds, else a compile-free approximate source parse — never mocked to force a compile.

| `_write_mechanical_report_tier` | `scripts/plamen_mechanical.py:10618` | `report_records.json`, tier assignments, `verification_queue.md` | `report_critical_high.md`, `report_medium.md`, or `report_low_info.md` | Writes a severity-tier report markdown file directly from verified finding records, with per-severity H2 headers so the assembler can route each finding to the correct section |

### Substrate

Shared, contract- and Markdown-parsing primitives that the categories above are built on.

| Function | Location | Consumes | Produces | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| `write_contract_sidecar` | `scripts/plamen_contracts.py:287` | a validated pydantic contract model, optional companion markdown path | `<sidecar_name>.json` | Writes a validated contract model to its JSON sidecar, idempotently (skips a byte-identical rewrite modulo timestamp) and embeds the companion Markdown's fingerprint for staleness detection |
| `read_contract_sidecar` | `scripts/plamen_contracts.py:319` | `<sidecar_name>.json`, optional companion markdown fingerprint | a validated contract model, or a raised `ContractError` | Reads and schema-validates a JSON sidecar; returns `None` only when the sidecar is absent, but hard-raises `ContractError` (never silently falls back) when present-but-invalid or stale relative to its companion Markdown |
| `load_contract` | `scripts/plamen_contracts.py:365` | scratchpad, a `PlamenContract` subclass, optional raw markdown | a validated contract model or `None` | Uniform contract resolution ladder: authoritative JSON sidecar if valid, hard-fail if present-but-invalid, else the legacy section-scoped Markdown importer, else `None` |
| `section_tokens` | `scripts/plamen_markdown.py:80` | raw markdown text, a heading pattern | a token-list slice | Section-scoped Markdown AST slice: returns only the tokens belonging to the first heading matching a pattern, up to the next equal-or-higher-level heading, so a same-named table in a different section can never bleed in |
| `section_text` | `scripts/plamen_markdown.py:125` | raw markdown text, a heading pattern | a source-text substring | Same section-scoping as `section_tokens` but returns the raw source substring, letting a caller keep its existing line-based row parser bounded to the correct section |

## Worker contract

Worker artifacts (breadth, depth, rescan, per-contract) carry an HTML-comment envelope of `PLAMEN_*` markers. The canonical 7-line `PLAMEN_STATUS` marker block is defined in `docs/architecture.md`; internals.md summarizes how the driver consumes it.

### Marker-driven row verdicts

For each manifest row, `compute_phase_row_statuses` returns one of four verdicts (`scripts/plamen_validators.py:1488-1506`):

| Verdict | Meaning | Driver action |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **complete** | File exists, `PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE` is present, structural completeness passes | Row is locked in; not retried |
| **in_progress** | File has `PLAMEN_*` markers but `STATUS != COMPLETE`, or unmarked on a fresh-audit scratchpad | Re-queued on the next worker-pool attempt |
| **wrong-phase** (`structural_fail`) | File is `COMPLETE` but fails a required-heading / placeholder / receipts check | Re-queued with structural-failure reasons surfaced to the next worker |
| **stale-legacy** (`legacy_unmarked`) | Substantive content but no `PLAMEN_ARTIFACT` marker on a legacy/resumed scratchpad | Passes with warning; the supervision loop ignores it (treated as pre-existing) |

**`DONE` is advisory for worker phases.** The driver never trusts Claude's natural-language completion claim for breadth/depth/rescan/per-contract; only the marker envelope and the structural gate decide whether a row is locked in. This is the load-bearing rule that the entire artifact-complete PTY supervision design is built around.

### Agent-row routing markers

To reconcile the manifest with returned `agentId:` handles, every Task/Agent dispatch prompt the orchestrator builds embeds two routing markers verbatim:

```
AGENT_ROW: B3
EXPECTED_OUTPUT: analysis_access_control.md
```

`pty_exec.parse_transcript_agentids` (`scripts/pty_exec.py:384-460`) scans the session transcript and produces `{agent_row: {agent_id, expected_output, handle, description}}`, so the supervision loop can build a continuation message that names paused subagents by their manifest row (e.g. "B3 / analysis_access_control.md") instead of the opaque handle. Dispatches missing the `AGENT_ROW` marker are skipped (the parser never fabricates a row name from a handle).

---

## PTY transport

The PTY transport is what makes the worker-pool model viable: each worker is its own Claude session with its own bidirectional terminal, supervised by the driver. The architecture-level walkthrough lives in `docs/architecture.md`; the implementation contract is summarized here.

### POSIX

- Master/slave pair via `pty.openpty()`, child launched with `subprocess.Popen(..., stdin=slave_fd, stdout=slave_fd, stderr=slave_fd, preexec_fn=_child_setup)` (`scripts/pty_exec.py:574-606`).
- `_child_setup` resets `SIGCHLD` to `SIG_DFL`, calls `os.setsid()`, and assigns the controlling terminal via `fcntl.ioctl(slave_fd, termios.TIOCSCTTY, 0)`. Each child becomes its own process group so `os.killpg` can clean up.
- Driver resets `SIGCHLD` before spawn (the parent may have inherited a non-default disposition from Claude Code, which otherwise causes children to appear reaped immediately).

### Windows

- `winpty.PtyProcess.spawn(argv, cwd=cwd, env=env, dimensions=(40, 120))` (`scripts/pty_exec.py:549-557`).
- `send_continuation` writes the message, waits 0.75s for the prompt box to settle, then sends a CR via `proc.sendcontrol("m")` with a `\r\n` fallback (`scripts/pty_exec.py:647-655`).

### Parent-Claude env stripping

At every spawn site, the child env is built via `_filtered_child_subprocess_environ`, which strips `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH`, and `AI_AGENT` (`scripts/plamen_driver.py:104-117`, mirrored in `scripts/preflight_pty_transports.py:77-83`). Without this filter, a child `claude` spawned from inside a Claude Code session detects a nested live session and exits `rc=0` without doing any work. The same filter is applied at all five spawn sites in `plamen_driver.py`.

### Preflight cache

`preflight_pty_transports.py` probes whether the host's PTY transport is functional and caches the result per-host. Cache schema version is `_SCHEMA_VERSION = 3` (`scripts/preflight_pty_transports.py:62`); v3 invalidates any pre-env-strip false-negative caches. Cache files written with an older schema are ignored.

---

## Discovery aids

A driver-generated artifact steers depth workers toward unbound or under-justified value flows without prescribing findings:

- **`security_obligations.md`** — feature-derived obligation ledger. When present, depth workers read it as input 5 (`prompts/shared/v2/phase4b-depth.md:230`) and emit per-obligation receipts in their output (`[OBLIG:security_obligations.md:<SO-ID>] STATUS:R|D|C ...`).

It is consumed by depth workers; not a gate input.

---

## ID identity

Finding IDs flow through three regimes:

1. **Provisional analysis IDs** — assigned by breadth/depth/chain workers in their own output files (e.g. `[CS-1]`, `[TF-3]`, `[BLIND-2]`, `CH-2`). These are not stable and never appear in the client report.
2. **Canonical identity map** — `_write_canonical_finding_identity_map` (`scripts/plamen_mechanical.py:1049`) refreshes a driver-owned identity sidecar after every major discovery phase (`breadth`, `rescan`, inventory chunks, `depth`, `attention_repair`, `rag_sweep`, semantic dedup variants, chain variants, `post_verify_extract`, `skeptic`, `crossbatch`, `report_index`). Source artifacts are preserved; the map is additive.
3. **Final report IDs** — the `report_index` phase reassigns to clean sequential IDs grouped by severity tier: `C-01 / H-01 / M-01 / L-01 / I-01`. Tier writers and the report assembler consume only these IDs; internal pipeline IDs are explicitly forbidden in the client-facing report (see `rules/report-template.md`).

---

## Concurrency control

A per-scratchpad file lock prevents two driver invocations from racing on the same audit:

- Lock file: `<scratchpad>/.plamen_run.lock` (`_RUN_LOCK_NAME`, `scripts/plamen_driver.py:15820`).
- Payload records PID and acquisition timestamp; held for the lifetime of the driver process.

When the user presses Esc / halts the run, the driver cancels queued workers and terminates in-flight ones with a bounded grace period:

- `_cancel_pending_worker_futures` (`scripts/plamen_driver.py:1992-2007`) cancels each pending `Future` and calls `executor.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` — it does **not** wait for the pool to drain.
- In-flight workers receive `SIGTERM` (POSIX `os.killpg`) or `terminate(force=False)` (Windows winpty), then `SIGKILL` / `kill` after `_HALT_TERMINATE_GRACE_S = 2.0` seconds (`scripts/plamen_driver.py:1939`). The same grace window is used at every PTY-session termination site in the driver.
