# Usage

> **Just installed?** See [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) first — what's required, what's optional, and how to run your first audit.

All invocations -- terminal CLI, Claude Code slash commands, and Codex CLI -- launch the same V2 deterministic driver (`plamen_driver.py`). Most phases run as a single isolated `claude -p` (or `codex exec`) subprocess; **breadth, depth, and rescan** run as driver-supervised PTY worker pools with one Claude PTY per worker artifact and disk-derived completion (`<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE -->`). See [pipeline-phases-presentation.md](pipeline-phases-presentation.md) for the per-phase execution shape. The driver provides automatic checkpointing, manifest-exact retry (only missing/bad worker rows re-spawn, not whole phases), gating, rate-limit pause/resume, and haltless resilience — late phases repair-then-degrade and flag unfinished obligations in the report instead of throwing away a finished audit. Bookkeeping-heavy stages (report_index recovery, verify backfill, finding dedup) run as deterministic Python rather than fragile LLM prose-parsing.

## Quick Start

### Terminal (recommended)

```bash
plamen                                  # Interactive wizard
plamen core /path/to/project            # SC audit, Core mode
plamen l1 thorough /path/to/node-client # L1 audit, Thorough mode
```

### Claude Code

```
/plamen-wizard          # SC audit — interactive config then driver launch
/plamen-l1-wizard       # L1 infrastructure audit
```

### Codex CLI (beta)

The OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex exec`) is supported as an alternative, cost-saving backend (beta). It runs one `codex exec` per depth job, detects usage caps from natural-language output and auto-waits instead of halting, and seeds the full mandatory first-pass artifact set so recon/depth degrade losslessly.

> **Before relying on Codex**, read [codex-backend.md](codex-backend.md) — it consolidates the known BETA limitations: reduced fan-out vs Claude, MCP tools partially disabled (WebSearch fallback), interactive-only MCP permissions, speculative model mapping with silent downgrade, ChatGPT-auth/usage-cap behavior, and that `plamen compare` is Claude-only.

Codex requires prior setup: `plamen install --codex`, which also installs the
slash commands into `~/.codex/commands/` (from `codex-adapter/commands/`). After
that, either invoke the slash commands (e.g. `/plamen-wizard`, `/plamen-l1-wizard`)
the same way as in Claude Code, or use the terminal wrapper directly:

```
$plamen core /path/to/project
$plamen l1 core /path/to/node-client
```

## PATH Setup

To use `plamen` as a command (instead of `python plamen.py`):

```bash
# Linux (bash)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.plamen:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# macOS (zsh)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.plamen:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell, one-time)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:USERPROFILE\.plamen;" + $env:Path, "User")
```

Or run directly: `python3 ~/.plamen/plamen.py` (macOS/Linux) or `python ~/.plamen/plamen.py` (Windows).

---

## Resuming an Interrupted Audit

The driver checkpoints after each phase. If the process crashes, hits rate limits, or is interrupted:

```bash
# Auto-detect and resume
plamen resume

# Resume a specific config
plamen resume /path/to/project/.scratchpad/config.json

# Direct driver launch (advanced)
python3 ~/.plamen/scripts/plamen_driver.py /path/to/project/.scratchpad/config.json

# Fresh restart (discard previous progress)
python3 ~/.plamen/scripts/plamen_driver.py --fresh /path/to/project/.scratchpad/config.json
```

From Claude Code, running `/plamen-wizard` auto-detects an existing scratchpad and offers to resume.

Each scratchpad has a `.plamen_run.lock` that prevents concurrent driver invocations against the same audit. If a stale process owns the lock from a previous crash, the driver refuses to start until the lock is cleared — `rm .scratchpad/.plamen_run.lock` removes it.

---

## Running from inside Claude Code

`/plamen` and `/plamen-wizard` can be launched while a parent Claude Code session is active. The driver strips the parent's Claude identity env vars (`CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH`, `AI_AGENT`) from every child subprocess so the nested `claude` invocations start as fresh sessions instead of detecting a nested-active-session and exiting rc=0 with no work done. The same applies on macOS/Linux where the POSIX PTY layer additionally resets inherited `SIGCHLD` disposition before each spawn (see [architecture.md § PTY Transport](architecture.md)).

---

## Operator controls and runtime behavior

- **Escape / halt**: pressing Escape (or sending a halt signal) cancels every **queued** worker immediately via `_cancel_pending_worker_futures` and terminates **in-flight** workers with a 2-second grace (`_HALT_TERMINATE_GRACE_S = 2.0`) before SIGKILL. The driver then exits with rc=−3 so you can resume with `plamen resume`.
- **Compaction heartbeat**: Claude auto-compacting its context during a worker turn prints a single informational line ("Claude compacted context; continuing normally (disk gate is source of truth)"). This is **not a warning** — the driver continues under disk-gate validation. If the artifact reaches `PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE`, the worker is done regardless of compaction notice.
- **Worker-pool progress**: operators see live per-worker progress directly in the UI (no longer hidden inside Claude's Task tool stdio). File creation, marker transitions (`IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETE`), and worker completion events are all visible.
- **Multiple Claude PTY processes**: during breadth/rescan/depth you will see multiple `claude` processes in the process tree — one per worker artifact. This is expected (driver-owned worker pool), not duplication or runaway processes.
- **Ecosystem auto-detect**: the driver mechanically detects the codebase ecosystem (EVM, Solana, Aptos, Sui, Soroban, DAML, or L1 Go/Rust) at startup, shows it on the banner, and auto-corrects a mismatched `config.language` in place — no halt-to-rerun. Detection is recall-safe: it only overrides on a genuine high/medium-confidence mismatch, and on ambiguity it keeps the configured value and warns rather than guessing. Corrections are surfaced on the TUI (`[startup] auto-detected ecosystem=...`).
- **Haltless completion (degrade-with-flag)**: a finished audit is never discarded at the finish line. If a late phase (report_index, verify, inventory, or resume) cannot fully complete, the driver repairs what it can, then degrades and surfaces the unfinished obligation as a flagged human-review item in `AUDIT_REPORT.md` rather than halting the run. Stale or corrupt checkpoints recover instead of stranding the audit.

## When to Use Which

| | Terminal (`plamen`) | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First time** | Use this | `/plamen-wizard` | Need Codex + tools |
| **Cost estimate** | Shows estimate | No estimate | No estimate |
| **Resume on crash** | `plamen resume` | `/plamen-wizard` (auto-detects) | `$plamen resume` |
| **Daily use** | `plamen core .` | `/plamen-wizard` | `$plamen core .` |

---

## Cost Estimation

The terminal wrapper estimates token usage before launch:
- Input/Output tokens (millions)
- API cost (USD)
- Weekly plan usage (% of Pro, Max x5, Max x20)

Estimates are rough -- actual usage varies with protocol complexity. Run `/cost` after an audit for actuals.

> `plamen --estimate TARGET MODE [--scope PATH] [--l1]` is an **internal** flag invoked by the `/plamen` slash command and the interactive wizard to produce a per-project estimate (printed as JSON). It is not part of the supported direct-CLI option set and is intentionally omitted from `plamen help`; use the interactive `plamen` wizard for a standalone cost estimate.
